Becoming location independent clears the way for you to start working from
anywhere in the world.

For anyone who's ever considered long-term travel, location-independent income
is a non-negotiable part of the process.

Getting started, though, can be stressful — and scary as hell.

Let me start by telling you how I made the transition out of the traditional
workplace and into a role that allows me to make a living no matter where I am
in the world. (Hello from Thailand!)

Afterward, I'll go over several options for making a living from anywhere in the
world.

## My Departure from the 9-to-5

When I was in my early twenties, I moonlighted as a freelance web developer
while keeping 9-to-5 jobs ranging from a night auditor at a hotel to a project
manager at a Kinko's to a graveyard shift cook at a bowling alley diner.

I knew I wanted to work for myself, but I had no idea where to start. I only had
a few clients, and sometimes I would go a month between jobs. What if I couldn't
find work? What if I couldn't pay my rent?

My last job — working at Kinko's — was a huge help in building my resolve to
avoid corporate culture. Kinko's had just been acquired by FedEx, and I watched
as all the things that Kinko's used to do for employees that made them love
their jobs were systematically stripped away and replaced with more aggressive
performance goals and stricter punishments for missing them —all with little or
no reward for meeting goals.

For a year I watched FedEx methodically dismantle employee morale. I kept my
spirits up by working my off hours on web projects, repeating to myself over and
over, _This is just for now. Things will get better soon._

### A Terrifying Glimmer of Hope

When I got my chance, it felt like a bad idea.

My [good friend][1] had introduced me to a guy named David, who was trying to
start a company building simple websites for B-list-or-lower actors and
performers. His budget wasn't huge, but he could offer me $1,300/month for three
months.

At the time, I was spending about $1,050/month on living expenses. If I took
David's offer, I'd have $250/month to pay my mobile phone bill, buy any
necessities, and, y'know, _eat._

And it was only three months of guaranteed income. What if he didn't renew for a
fourth month? What if I didn't have any income?

### The Siren Song of Security

The same week I started discussing David's project, I got an unexpected offer
from a local creative agency. They asked me to come in and interview with them —
they'd heard of me because of my volunteer work with a local coders' meetup.

I went through the interview process, which involved several days' worth of
meetings with different department heads.

Finally, they told me they were prepared to offer me a job as a web developer
and designer. I would more or less be the entirety of their digital department.

At the meeting, we finally got down to heavy details.

"We'd want to bring you in at a mid-range salary to show you that we're
serious," said the woman who made the hiring decisions. "We can offer you
$30,000/year."

I felt a rush of mixed emotions. On the one hand, $2,500/month was more than I'd
ever made before, and it would provide me with significantly more spending money
than the freelance gig. But on the other hand, $30K was a _mid-range_ developer
salary at this agency? I didn't know what was normal, but this felt pretty low
to me.

"Okay," I started carefully, "so assuming this all goes well and I'm a good fit
for the team. What's my growth potential here? Would I be able to see an
increase in that salary after proving I'm able to handle the workload here?"

She shifted uncomfortably. "Well, yes. I would say you have the potential to
make up to $35,000 a year here, assuming everything goes well."

I felt my heart sink. I had a vision of software development at an ad agency as
a glamorous job, full of challenging work and long hours, but with high pay to
make it all worth it. But this job was offering me less than my manager at
Kinko's made in a year, with virtually no growth potential.

But still...

A little voice[^mom] nagged at me that this was _security_ and _stability_ and
_a steady paycheck_. I wouldn't have to worry.

### Getting By on Ramen Noodles and Hope

I didn't sleep much the next few days. I kept rolling around my options.

The logical part of me was convinced. _Take the agency job. Sure, it's not a lot
of money, but it's experience that you can use to trade up in a couple years.
And it's not like you're taking a pay cut to move into a job you like._

But my gut didn't feel right.

_You're only considering this agency job because you're a chickenshit,_ it
hissed at me. _You've been telling everyone you know that you just need a chance
to be self-employed, and now you have that chance. So are you going to take it?
Or are you a liar and a coward?_

I was right, I realized. I had been looking for this chance for over a year, and
now it was in my hands. If I turned it down, I couldn't be sure how long it
would take to get another chance like it.

I called the agency and declined, citing my concerns about growth potential.
They seemed miffed, but it also sounded like they were already expecting me to
turn it down.

I called David and accepted the contract. He told me he'd drop the check in the
mail that day.

I put in my two weeks' notice at Kinko's.

And then I bought a pallet of ramen noodles, sat down on my couch, and
hyperventilated for the rest of the evening.

### The Payoff

After leaving Kinko's, a funny thing happened.

Leads I'd been talking to for months without any movement were suddenly ready to
pull the trigger. I started getting new leads around town.

It was almost like people could smell that I'd started taking web development
seriously. I was no longer doing web design on the side; _I was a web developer,
full stop._

Between receiving David's first check and the end of our contract (five months
later), I had built up enough business to be bringing in an average of
$3,000/month. If I could keep this up, I'd make $36,000 or so for the year —
more than the agency would have paid assuming they found me especially good.

I was terrified to leave the security of my day job. I was convinced that I had
no hope of making a decent living on my own. I was sure that the concerns of my
parents, past employers, teachers — basically every adult I'd ever met — were
correct and that the only way to really make it was to get a "real" job: the
kind with health insurance and paid vacation and annual reviews.

But my instincts said there was a better way. And I took a leap of faith, [set
myself on fire][2], and trusted myself to be okay.

And my life has never been the same since. I'm happier now, more confident in
myself, less bothered by the unknown — every part of my life improved as a
direct result of taking charge of my life and becoming self-employed.

## What Options Exist for Remote Work?

There are many options for making a living without having to be physically
present in a particular place. Three of the most common (and versatile) options
are:

1. Create a passive income stream
2. Convince your boss to let you work remotely
3. Work from anywhere as a freelancer

## Create Passive Income

Passive income is the most alluring form of making money remotely. After all,
who doesn't want to make money while they sleep?

My personal experience with passive income has been generating it for other
people; my own passive revenue streams are limited to affiliate sales on Amazon,
book royalties, and whatever my investments earn — in short, it's a very small
part of my overall income.

For that reason, I won't talk too much about generating passive income. There
are other people more qualified to cover the subject — check out Chris
Guillebeau's [_$100 Startup_][3] for a good starting point.

### Digital Products

The most successful passive revenue stream I've been able to reproduce for my
clients has been digital products.

For example, my friend and client [Jonathan Goodman][4] runs a business from all
over the world that sells digital products helping personal trainers become
better at personal training, selling their services, and establishing additional
revenue streams like online coaching. He has a small handful of products — most
of which he created, built a marketing funnel for, and hasn't had to touch
(much) since — that earn him a comfortable living without a lot of weekly
effort.

### Online Services

Another friend and client, [John "Roman" Romaniello][5], has built passive
income by creating companies that he more or less only provides ideas for.

Roman's created an online client management platform that he uses for his own
online clients, but that he also sells to other coaches on a monthly basis.

He has a development team to keep it afloat, a management and marketing team to
keep it running smoothly, and various other people on his team to take care of
the day-to-day operation of the company — his only real job at the company is to
give direction for what the team should focus on next.

### "Passive" Is Kind of a Misnomer

It's important, though, to note that while Jon doesn't have to put a lot of
effort into building the products themselves, and Roman doesn't need to deal
with much of the daily operations of his coaching platform, both of these guys
spend _a lot of time_ working on creating content and staying active on social
media.

Passive income is very rarely _completely_ passive, after all.

## Find a Full-Time Job That Lets You Work Remotely

In some ways, this is a little bit like having your cake and eating it too.

If you can find full-time employment that's entirely remote, you've effectively
managed to hold on to the security of a 9-to-5 job while also gaining the
freedom of working from anywhere in the world.

### Hunt for Remote Jobs

These days, being a remote worker is no longer uncommon. Many notable companies,
including Automattic (the company that built WordPress), Basecamp, and Buffer
are almost entirely remote, and [reports claim][6] that 3.3 million full-time
employees in the US workforce were able to telecommute at least part of the time
as of 2013.

For anyone looking to start a new career, or move to a new job, there are a
large number of job boards that specialize exclusively in listing remote jobs,
such as:

* [remoteok.io][7]
* [jobs.remotive.io][8]
* [weworkremotely.com][9]
* [WFH.io][10]

There are quite a few other options — if you're looking for remote work, you
won't have too much trouble finding companies willing to hire you.

### Convince Your Boss to Let You Work Remotely

This is a little more challenging, but if you feel confident that you can do
your existing job without going into the office, it's worth trying to convince
your boss that it's possible.

Make a strong case for why the company would be better off with you
telecommuting, and build trust in your ability to work from anywhere.

(For an in-depth strategy, read [_How to Convince Your Boss to Let You Work
Remotely_][11].)

## Freelance Remotely

Simultaneously the simplest and most difficult way to make a living remotely,
freelancing is one of the most common approaches taken by digital nomads.

It's the riskiest prospect because there's no guarantee of work, but with a
little care and a lot of effort, you can build a strong referral network to keep
your sales funnel full.

### Position Yourself as an Expert

Find things that you're very good at and interested in — the things you get
excited talking about — and start teaching them: speak at local meetups, submit
conference talk proposals, write tutorials, and do anything you can to publicly
stake a claim that you "get" whatever arena you want to work in.

This makes you appear to be an authority, and people looking for freelancers
want to hire the best available help.

As an added bonus, **nothing will force you to _really_ know your shit like
trying to teach it to someone else.** You can't gloss over details when you're
explaining it to someone else.

### Make Damn Sure You Get a Good Referral

When you're working remotely, you may not get the chance to go out and meet your
clients — especially in more remote locations — so you need to make sure that
other people are doing your sales for you.

When you get a client, become their hero. They've come to you to solve a
problem, so solve that problem completely, and make sure they know what's going
on at all times.

If you can A) solve your clients' problems for them, and B) make sure they never
felt like you had disappeared[^communication] during the project, you're almost
ensured a good referral.

At the end of each successful project, it's a good idea to ask your client to
either send you a testimonial (you can use this for marketing, too) or ask them
to complete a survey about your performance — in either case, they finish the
project by reminding themselves all the things they liked about working with
you. Later, when a friend mentions a problem that you can solve, your client
will be eager to drop your name.

## Remove the Anchor of Office-Bound Work

Removing the anchor of reporting to an office every day is an astonishingly
liberating accomplishment, whether your goal is to [sell everything and travel
the world][12], or simply to cut your commute and eliminate the requirement to
wear pants.

It's also daunting, and it requires some legwork to make it happen. But don't
give up — I've yet to meet _anyone_ who made the transition to remote work and
regretted it.

[^mom]:
  This voice sounded alarmingly similar to my mother's.

[^communication]:
  \#protip: The window of time between your last communication and when the client will wonder what you're doing is much shorter than you think. Daily communication is ideal — you don't need to deliver something every day, but make sure they know you're working on their project.
