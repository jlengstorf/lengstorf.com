    When I was a kid, I loved the heavy, dark, sad movies. Now I just want a story to make me smile, even if the plot is completely ridiculous.

Yesterday I watched Robert Redford die -- slowly and tortuously -- for two
hours.

I was watching his new movie, [_All Is Lost_][1], which is **killing it** on
Rotten Tomatoes (currently rocking a 94% rating). I left the theater feeling
heavy, sad, despondent. It was rough. I didn't much care for it.

That's not to say _All Is Lost_ is a bad movie. It's well-made, and Robert
Redford is a solid actor.

But Jesus! what a draining way to spend an afternoon.

## My Nineteen-Year-Old Self Is So Ashamed Right Now

Now, I'm saying all this as Present Tense Jason, who is very different from
Jason of Yore; in fact, the latter would spit right in my face for what I'm
about to say.

As I've gotten (somewhat) older and seen (a bit) more of the world, I've lost
interest in the movies that used to top my list. Gone are the days of repeated
viewings of [_A Clockwork Orange_][2]; no longer do I want to sit down and
really **experience** a film like [_Requiem for a Dream_][3].

I still think they're good movies -- great ones, even -- but god*damn* are they
depressing.

When I was a kid it was important to me that my movie choices felt authentic,
and didn't cloud the story with fluffy Hollywood nonsense. I wanted heroes who
could die, and stories that twisted and turned and gave you hope before killing
the main character -- y'know, because life is like that sometimes.

## Art Imitating Life

Every year I read about some movie that raises the bar for authenticity. Some
[movie about Osama Bin Laden][4] put all the actors through real military
training, or some French filmmaker had his actors [_actually_ have sex during
the love scenes][5]. Even the superhero movies are coming up with
as-plausible-as-you-can-make-a-superhero-backstory origin stories -- apparently
so we can all avoid the burden of suspending our disbelief for 105 minutes.

It's all pushing toward a true-to-life experience. And a good portion of it is
terribly hard to watch because it's so depressing.

## Make 'Em Laugh

You can take away my cinephile card if you want, but these days, I just want to
be entertained, not bashed in the skull repeatedly with an emotional
sledgehammer. I'm sick of feeling bad when the credits start rolling, or after
finishing a book.

I want to hear a great story about characters that make me want to be better,
filled with heroes who win by being smarter and more determined than the
villains; about couples who believe so deeply in true love that even
insurmountable obstacles can be surmounted; about wizened old mentors who teach
just the right lesson at just the right moment.

_I want things to work out in the end._

I know life is hard, and that not everything ends well. There are little
reminders of life's hardships and inconveniences all over the place.

Why, then, would I want additional reminders while I'm trying to relax and take
my mind _off_ the world's ills?

## Just Be Awesome

It's not that I want nothing but romantic comedies. I just want more stories
involving people being awesome, and that leave me feeling better than when I
started.

Don't show me [Paul Giamatti slowly self-destructing][6] in a moody downward
spiral. Instead, show me Cary Elwes [outsmarting Sicilians and besting
giants][7] to rescue his true love.
