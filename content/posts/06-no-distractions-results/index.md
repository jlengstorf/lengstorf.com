    A few days ago I planned an experiment in which I turned off email, the phone, and chat programs to focus on high-concentration work. These are the results.

I made today an experiment in single-tasking to see if it would make me more
productive without setting the house on fire. Here's what I learned.

Last week I talked about the [benefits of working without distractions][1] and
laid the ground rules for an experiment with my own working style.

It's currently just before midnight, and I'm willing to call the experiment a
resounding success.

Here's a recap and some stats from my No-Distractions Experiment.

## The Schedule

**7:00AM:** Alarm goes off. I have two hours before I have to be anywhere — I
told myself last night that I'd use this time to shoot off a couple quick emails
before the experiment officially started. Instead I hit the snooze for half an
hour, then get sucked into an article on [The Pastry Box Project][2].

**8:00AM:** I finally get out of bed and walk over to get a cup of coffee. I
talk with Tim the barista about Miami and how he almost moved to Little Haiti
once.

**9:00AM:** I arrive at [Elemental Fitness Lab][3] and manage to neither throw
up nor cry during the workout. I take this as a good omen.

**10:15AM:** Ali and I head for a quick breakfast so we can spend some time
together before I abandon her for the day.

**10:52AM:** I notify the world that this experiment is beginning, because
_obviously_ everyone is waiting with bated breath to hear the details of my work
day.

**11:00AM:** The first no-distractions block begins, scheduled for 3 hours. I am
able to accomplish:

* A preliminary reorganization of my todos by difficulty, since the hard stuff
  should probably happen while I have time to focus
* Clearing of the Bitbucket issue tracker on two works in progress for Copter
  clients
* Site adjustments for the paperback release of [Lou Schuler's][4] latest book,
  _The New Rules of Lifting: Supercharged_
* Design updates for a site we're working on with [Jon Goodman][5]

**3:00PM:** Break for lunch. It's been nice not having my phone buzzing at me,
so I leave it off.

**4:15PM:** The second no-distractions block kicks off. I had originally planned
this to go from 3:30–6:30, but I worked a little longer on the first block than
I expected, so I decide to play this one by ear. I accomplish:

* Art revisions for [Keri Glassman][6]'s forthcoming new site
* New functionality over on the [Train Heroic][7] site
* Style and navigation improvements for [Protein Pow][8]
* Site tweaks and a couple new features for [Roman][9]'s site
* A quick fix for [Neghar Fonooni][10]

**7:45PM:** I realize that I'm still working. Ali has food for us, so I eat with
her and decide that the no-distractions part of my day is over. I still feel
like I've got some productive hours left in the tank, though, so I put together
two new logo concepts while we catch up on a couple TV shows.

**11:45PM:** I stop working and start writing this post.

## A Few Key Metrics

I had two big concerns coming into this experiment:

1. I was worried my team and my clients would be stuck waiting on me for
   something, causing tension and delays
2. I was worried the lack of interruption might result in a lackadaisical
   attitude on my part, resulting in _lower_ overall productivity

To measure the validity of my first concern, I figured the easiest way would be
to see A) how much email I received during the day, and B) whether I had
actually caused any bottlenecks.

* Current number of emails in my inbox: 173
* Number of emails that are unread (from today): 67
* Number of emails (estimated) that will require action on my part: ~40
* Number of bottlenecks I created: 0

My second concern definitely proved false, but just for fun, here are some
stats:

* Number of todos I started the day with: 52
* Number of todos I completed: 27

Finally, just because I'm using a [cool app][11] that lets me track this crap,
here's where my time _actually_ went today:

* Total time on the computer today: 12:05
* Google Chrome: 4:22 (with only 16 minutes total between Facebook and Twitter)
* Photoshop: 3:08
* Illustrator: 2:43
* Sublime Text: 0:46

The remainder of my time was split up between apps like Finder, Transmit, Font
Book, and other utility apps.

## What I'm Taking Away from This

I learned a few important things today that I think will benefit me quite a bit
moving forward.

Most importantly, I learned that **the world doesn't stop if I'm not around.**
My team had no issues keeping the wheels turning on open projects, and not a
single issue came up that wasn't handled easily and quickly.

I also learned that **I'm well-suited for work-a-thons.** I put in about 12
hours today, and as I write this I'm not feeling drained, overworked, or unhappy
about it.

I feel good about the way today went, and it shows the potential to give me a
way to get the high-concentration work during the week instead of on the
weekends when email dies down.

For now, at least, **I'm going to give the no-distractions day a shot once a
week** and see how things go. If it goes well enough, I might even try a
Tuesday-Thursday no-distractions schedule, with Monday-Wednesday-Friday
dedicated to email, meetings, phone calls, and other lower-concentration tasks.

If every no-distractions day goes as well as today for me, I might even —
_GASP!_ — get [my weekends back][12].
