"I’ll be happy once I solve this problem." But with the solution comes new
problems. Can we ever be happy? Or do we only pursue happiness and never feel
it?

## ...I Get This Toy

In 1989 I was obsessed with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

I dressed up as a Ninja Turtle for something like four straight Halloweens,
watched a VHS tape with a few cartoon episodes until I literally wore it out,
and owned dozens of TMNT toys.

So when the [pizza thrower][1] came out, _I had to have it._

I begged. I bargained.[^next-birthday] I threw tantrums.

And on Christmas morning, 1989, I found a gift just the right size under the
tree. The clouds parted, an other-worldly glow illuminated the box, and an
angelic Foot Clan choir burst into [_Ninja Rap_][2] as I unwrapped the pizza
thrower.

I had imagined this moment for months.[^reality] It was going to _change
playtime forever_ — all of my friends would be _so_ jealous. I would _never_ get
sick of this toy.

**I'd be so happy once I had this toy.**

Within days — maybe even hours — I had lost all the pizzas. And besides, I could
never hit my target anyways because the pizzas were stupid and probably broken
or something.

I lost interest before the batteries died.

## ...I'm Free

In 2009 I was obsessed with independence.

I had just ended a serious relationship, and I had a job at FedEx Office to keep
the lights on while I pursued a full-time freelancing career in web design.

I had imagined self-employment for years. No boss! No office! No pants!

**I'd be so happy once I worked for myself.**

Toward the end of the year, I had landed one client. He agreed to pay me an
amount that would _just_ cover my rent and phone bill. The contract would last
three months.

I put in my notice at FedEx, bought a pallet of Top Ramen, and took the plunge
into working for myself.

My business grew, and soon I was able to buy a bottle of sriracha to add a
little excitement to my ramen.

And then I needed to pay taxes. And decide if I was going to be a
sole-proprietor, and LLC, or an S-corporation. And figure out how billing works.
And come up with an agreement to sign with new clients.

The list grew so quickly that I went to bed most nights feeling that I'd made a
huge mistake and that I needed to find a new job immediately.

## ...Ever I'm Moving Forward

In 2014, I'm obsessed with the journey.

I've realized that I won't find happiness in a goal: not a toy, not an act, not
an event.

Those goals are all milestones. Progress markers to let me know that I'm moving
in the direction I want to move in.

_But they're not the end of the journey._

Happiness is a continuum, not an possession. I've realized that I was looking at
happiness as a prize that I'd receive once I'd solved "the right problems".

I hadn't thought all that hard about it, but I was imagining a finish line,
where I'd cross the threshold, be greeted by [insert current celebrity crush
here] with a bouquet of flowers and a magic amulet that granted me happiness
henceforth, and I'd just be...done. With being alive.

I win, your princess is in this castle, game over, congratulations.

Which is the entire problem: **I was looking at happiness as a destination.**

Like, "Oh, I know I'll be happy once I get to the top of this mountain. I just
have to suffer through the climb and then all my problems will be solved!"

Then, upon reaching the summit, I'd think, "It's awful cold on this mountaintop.
What a fool I've been! Clearly, the answer is to make my way to that valley —
once I get there, all my problems will be solved!"

Now, climbing the mountain was necessary, because I couldn't see the valley
until I reached the summit. But I was looking at it all wrong: I was looking at
the mountain as the end of the journey instead of simply the next step in a
journey that only ends when I die.

**I was assigning all of the happiness to _completing_ the task, rather than finding joy in the process of learning, of working toward a goal, of improving bit by bit.**

I wasn't allowing myself to enjoy the fun part.

When I'm working toward a goal, I'm challenged. I'm out of my comfort zone and
learning new things.

But when I've achieved the goal, all of those challenges are gone (momentarily)
and I feel a sense of loss. Loss of purpose. Loss of a challenge.

**It's not until I find the next milestone to work toward that I'm happy again.**

## Changing the Conversation

I no longer say, "I'll be happy when..."

Instead, I say, "I'll be happy as long as..."

...as long as there's a new adventure ahead of me.

...as long as there's a challenge to overcome.

...as long as I'm surrounded by people who are smarter than me in the areas
where I want to improve.

...as long as I am doing the things that I've decided are important to me (and
not putting them off for the sake of obligations or laziness).

Because I don't know what I want tomorrow. I don't know what I'll see from the
top of the next mountain that I climb.

**But I know that I'll be happy as long as I'm climbing.**

[^next-birthday]:
  "No, Mom, I promise! If you get me this you don't have to get _anything_ for my next birthday! Honest," he said, for the third straight year.

[^reality]:
  In fairness, I was four years old, so it was probably only a few days.

[^fake-name]:
  Not her real name, for reasons that will become apparent.

[^clever]:
  I discovered this through masterfully surreptitious methods: "Are you a virgin?"

[^pervert]:
  Tammy was able to rent a hotel room at 16 because a middle-aged man ogling a teenage girl doesn't want to look at her ID to learn exactly how big a pervert he is.
