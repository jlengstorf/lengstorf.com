I use the term _"set yourself on fire"_ frequently. To me, it means a
sink-or-swim moment: **you'll either find a way to put this fire out, or you're toast.**

It removes the option to fail just a little bit. You now either make this work,
or you go down hard.

For me, and for most people I know, this is both horribly frightening and
incredibly motivating.

## From Drawing Garfield to Marketing a Band

When I was a musician[^musician], we had no income. On tour, we were lucky to
get paid $100 for a show, and sometimes we could pull together $50 in sales from
the merch table. It barely covered gas to get to the next city.

[^musician]:
  I use the term "musician" loosely, here.

There was no budget whatsoever, so things like "marketing budgets" were never
even discussed.

But there was a need for marketing: tour posters, merchandise, album art, web
banners, MySpace customizations, a website.

There was no one to do the work. We couldn't afford to hire help, and none of us
knew anything about that stuff.

I figured, "I drew pictures of Garfield and the Ninja Turtles when I was a kid;
I can figure out a tour poster."

I had no experience, and no idea what I was doing. But I couldn't see any reason
that I would fail. So **I set myself on fire.**

The posters weren't great. But they also weren't terrible.

The MySpace page went through several iterations, all of which were — let's be
honest, here — pretty MySpacey.

The first website I built [was horrible][1].[^wayback] It was a table-based
layout with no CSS, and it used iframes for content. But goddammit, if you
clicked our "shows" link, you saw a list of shows.

[^wayback]:
  This isn't actually the _very_ first site. The Wayback Machine doesn't have a copy of it, unfortunately.

Yeah, it sucked. But it worked. **And I fucking _built_ that.**

## From a Dude in a Band to a Web Designer

Over the few years that my band was touring, I rebuilt that website over a dozen
times. At first because I could see the horrible mistakes I was making, but then
it just became a fun thing for me to do in the downtime between soundcheck and
going onstage.

When the band broke up, my friend [Nate Green][2] asked me if I'd help him build
a website for his new personal brand.

I had no idea how to build a website someone else could manage, but I couldn't
see any reason that I would fail. **I set myself on fire again.**

Nate's website [wasn't ground-breaking][3], but it worked.

Nate's business grew, and I was suddenly a web designer.

## My Life, Slightly Singed

The challenges over the years have changed, but I've tried to keep my response
consistent: I can handle that.

If I look at a challenge and it doesn't put anyone in danger — I'm not going to
volunteer to build a rocket or perform open-heart surgery, here — I'll take it
on.

Yes, I can back that trailer into the boat slip.

Yes, I can cook a turkey.

Yes, I can work with [AngularJS][4].

In each of these scenarios (all of which are real moments in my life), I had
never done the thing I had just told someone I was able to do. But I trusted
myself to figure it out.

**I set myself on fire.**

In every case, I figured it out. I moved slowly, I did a _shitload_ of Googling,
and in the end I delivered a result that was good enough to make everyone
involved happy. And with practice, I'll get to the point that it's just a thing
I know.

## Set Yourself on Fire

What are you trying to learn right now? Have you been putting it off? How can
you remove your safety net so you _have to learn it?_

Have you set yourself on fire in the past? Or been set on fire by someone else?
