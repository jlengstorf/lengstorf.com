Growing up is weird.

If you’d asked me five years ago what I wanted my life to look like going into 2019, I can guaran-goddam-tee that whatever I described would be shockingly different than where I am right now.

I spent a lot of time in my life [telling myself a story about who I am](/stories), and

- back to my roots
- doing a bunch of things I thought I’d never do
- doubling down on community

What went well?
- https://alistapart.com/article/breaking-the-deadlock-between-user-experience-and-developer-experience
- Joined Gatsby (https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-09-07-gatsby-values/)
- Lots of podcasts
  - https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/28
  - https://changelog.com/podcast/306
  - https://spec.fm/podcasts/toolsday/134337
- Lots of speaking gigs
- Bought a house
- Worked on building a community in Portland
- Stayed consistent in the gym
- Kept learning and improving as a cook and hobbyist bartender

What could have gone better?
- I only have three posts between my 2017 retro and the 2018 retro. That's super disappointing.
- I didn’t pursue just-for-fun creative hobbies like music, art

What will I change going forward?
- Attempt to remove 7am meetings so I can write from 7–9-ish
- Sign up for (and commit to) at least one just-for-fun hobby (e.g. guitar lessons)
