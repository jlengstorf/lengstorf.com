I’ve spent a lot of time in my life thinking about what makes me angry. Not in the sense of creating a list of things I hate, or to build up a catalog of insults, but rather because I don’t like feeling angry and I’d prefer not to do it anymore.

And because I sometimes have more in common with robots that with human persons, I tend to run a lot of [retrospectives](/2019-q1-retrospective/) on scenarios that lead to me losing my temper.[^feelings]

[^feelings]:
  At this point, [Nate](https://nategreen.org) would probably object, saying that we should definitely feel our feelings. We have a tendency — especially men — to look at feeling things as embarrassing. I have no idea where this association came from, but somewhere along the lines, we seem to have associated “feeling an emotion” with the same level of shame as “farting loudly in public”.

  That’s not what this post is about, but in general I disagree with the idea that emotions should be avoided, tamped down, or otherwise controlled. We _should_ feel our feelings — though we shouldn’t let them control us. But — and this is a 10,000-foot “but” — _we need to learn from them._ That’s what I’m talking about in this post.

<Aside warning>

  **HUGE DISCLAIMER:** I’m going to be talking a lot about interpersonal relationships. I’m going to make the assumption in all of my examples that everyone involved isn’t deliberately seeking to cause anyone pain. In general, I’ve found [there aren’t many villains](/no-one-is-coming-to-save-you/) — but that certainly doesn’t mean they don’t exist. If you’re being targeted, this post isn’t going to hold true.

## Where do bad feelings come from?

How do our feelings get hurt? Why do we get angry? Where does shame come from?
