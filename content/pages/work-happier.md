Are you feeling overwhelmed with all the projects on your plate? Barely sleeping to keep up the demands of work and home? Working _way_ more than the 40 hours you're supposed to?

It's obvious that the way we work _isn't working_. But how can you fix it?

Does it feel like your only choices are:

1. Tough it out, keep hustling, and hope things change after this next deadline, or
2. Quit to save your sanity (not to mention your social life) and lose everything you've worked so hard to build?

## There's a third choice: you can have a great career and a great life.

**The best part? You don't have to make huge, sweeping changes to take back control of your life.**

In reality, there's no secret strategy or insider tip that will fix your balance. Instead, there are some small, practical, daily practices that will make an enormous difference in your level of happiness.

### Learn 3 blindingly obvious (and therefore painfully underappreciated) daily actions that will change your life — starting today.

This guide will show you three small, immediately-applicable actions you can take _today_ that will help you:

* **Get motivated.** Stop feeling buried. Start feeling unstoppable.
* **Supercharge your productivity.** Show up, kick ass, get out, and live your life.
* **Create more quality time.** Spend more time with the people you love.

These daily actions — if you choose to _actually follow through with them_ — will change your life.

And the best part is, making **these changes will have _no negative impact_ on your career.** (And, in fact, you'll probably see things _improve_ at work.)

### Are you ready to get your life back without sacrificing your career?
