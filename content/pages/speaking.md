Currently I’m focusing on giving presentations in the following areas:

-   **Work-Life Balance and Efficiency:** raising awareness about the health and career risks of overworking, teaching high-efficiency habits, encouraging downtime
-   **Building Effective Teams:** process design, designing healthy culture, onboarding, internal training
-   **Modern Front-End Development:** progressive web apps, high-performance patterns, React + GraphQL, architecture, testing, functional programming
-   **GraphQL:** managing GraphQL servers, using GraphQL in microservice architectures, combining GraphQL with REST

For a full list of the proposals I’m kicking around right now, see [my presentation list](https://github.com/jlengstorf/presentations). If I’ve given the presentation before, the slides are up there, too.
