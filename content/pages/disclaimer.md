This blog is personal, and not intended to solve any problems or diagnose any disease. So let’s just assume for everyone’s sake that I don’t know shit about shit, and you shouldn’t trust me at all.

Everything I say on this blog is an opinion, and there’s a reasonable chance that I’m absolutely wrong about everything.

Please seek the advice of a professional before trying anything I’ve written. All of my posts are written about things I did that worked for me. Your results may vary — try this stuff at your own risk.
