Your email is confirmed and goodies are inbound.

If I’ve never emailed you before, there’s a chance my messages will get sent to your spam folder. To make sure that doesn’t happen, consider adding <jason@lengstorf.com> to your address book. (A fast way to do that is to shoot me a quick email to say hi.)

You can also connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf).

Talk soon!
