If you're like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don't think you can pull it off.

I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States back in 2014 — and now _I can't believe I didn't start living this life sooner_.

The secret to a life on your terms — work where and when you want, living anywhere in the world — is **remote work**. And there's good news: it's easier than ever before to join the ranks of location-independent workers around the world.

**I want to help you. The best remote workers all have a set of non-technical skills, and I’ve put together a <a href="/remote-work-course" class="js--open-popover">free 6-point checklist</a> to help you master them — and ultimately master your time and ability to work anywhere in the world.**
