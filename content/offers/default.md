If you enjoyed this post, you may want to consider <a class="js--open-popover" href="/newsletter">joining my newsletter</a>. I'll send you messages about new content and occasionally send quicker thoughts and ideas _only_ to my subscribers. This is usually one or two emails a month.

I don't have comments on my blog, but I love hearing your feedback via email. I read everything I get and respond when I can.
