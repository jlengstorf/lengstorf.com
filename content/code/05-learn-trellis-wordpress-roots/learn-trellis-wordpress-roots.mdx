<Aside warning>

  **Heads up:** this post was written in 2016, and some of the tools and prices may have changed. The code _should_ still work, but you may want to look for a more up-to-date tutorial.

</Aside>

**Elevator Pitch:**

Set up a new WordPress site using the Roots stack.

## Prerequisites

- A private server (we'll walk through how to set this up for $5/month) — Trellis _cannot_ run on a shared host, so this isn't optional.
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (v1.0.7 used in this tutorial)

```bash
# Install Homebrew.
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (v2.10.1 used in this tutorial)

```bash
# Install Git with Homebrew
brew install git
```

- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) (v2.1.2.0 used in this tutorial)

```bash
# Install Ansible with Homebrew
brew install ansible
```

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (v1.2.1 used in this tutorial)

```bash
# Install Composer with Homebrew
brew install composer
```

- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (v5.0.18r106667 used in this tutorial)
- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) (v1.8.5 used in this tutorial)

## Part I: Install Trellis

To get things rolling, we need to grab a copy of Trellis from GitHub.

### Create a new directory for the site.

```bash
# Move into the directory where where you keep dev projects.
cd ~/dev/code.lengstorf.com/projects/

# Create a new directory for this project
mkdir learn-trellis

# Move into the new directory.
cd learn-trellis/
```

### Get a copy of Trellis to manage environments and deployment.

Since we want to track our copy of Trellis as its own project, we don't actually want the Trellis repo information. By adding `--depth=1` to the `clone` command, we're able to get only the most recently committed version (avoiding a lot of wasted bandwidth downloading the commit history). Then, we delete the `.git` directory so we can have our own Git project.

```bash
# Clone Trellis, but without all the Git history.
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:roots/trellis.git

# Delete the `.git` file so we can have our own Git repo.
rm -rf trellis/.git
```

### Install Ansible dependencies.

One of the most powerful parts of Ansible is the ability to use community-supplied scripts — called "roles" in the Ansible world — rather than having to write them from scratch or copy-paste them from various forums and tutorials.

This collection of community roles is called [Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/), and it's home to thousands of roles. Trellis uses several of these to configure a WordPress server, so we need to get those installed.

```bash
# Move into the Trellis directory
cd trellis/

# Install the Ansible dependencies for Trellis.
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

## Part II: Install Bedrock

We're not going to do talk much about Bedrock, but the short version is this: Bedrock makes WordPress development on a team much less frustrating by:

- Using [Composer to manage all dependencies](https://roots.io/bedrock/docs/composer/) — including WordPress plugins and the core itself — to make it easier to work with version control and develop across teams
- Easier [environment-specific configuration](https://roots.io/bedrock/docs/environment-variables/)
- Better security through [directory structure improvements](https://roots.io/bedrock/docs/folder-structure/) and the use of [better password encryption](https://github.com/roots/wp-password-bcrypt)

### Get a copy of Bedrock to make WordPress's file structure sane.

Just like we did with Trellis, we want to get a copy of Bedrock _without_ the Git repository. So we do a shallow clone and then remove the `.git` folder.

```bash
# Move back into the project root.
cd ..

# Clone Bedrock to the `site` directory.
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:roots/bedrock.git site

# Remove the `.git` file so we can have our own Git repo.
rm -rf site/.git
```

<Aside>

  **NOTE:** We aren't installing any themes in this tutorial, but we would do so by installing the theme with Composer, which installs it in `site/web/app/themes/`.

</Aside>

## Part III: Configure a Development Site

With all the proper dependencies installed, we can start configuring our development site, which will run on our computer.

<Aside>

  **NOTE:** If you've never used local development sites before, they're typically available at http://localhost/ or http://127.0.0.1/, and can (usually) only be accessed from the computer you're currently using. If you're used to using FTP or some other remote form of development, local development will save _days_ of your life.

</Aside>

### Add site details to `wordpress_sites.yml`.

Open `trellis/group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml` in your editor:

```yaml
# Documentation: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/local-development-setup/
# `wordpress_sites` options: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/wordpress-sites
# Define accompanying passwords/secrets in group_vars/development/vault.yml

wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    site_hosts:
      - canonical: example.dev
        redirects:
          - www.example.dev
    local_path: ../site # path targeting local Bedrock site directory (relative to Ansible root)
    admin_email: admin@example.dev
    multisite:
      enabled: false
    ssl:
      enabled: false
      provider: self-signed
    cache:
      enabled: false
```

If you're not familiar with [YAML](http://yaml.org/), it's a common way of describing data. It's indentation-based, so the default file creates a `wordpress_sites` object, and that contains an `example.com` object, which holds config properties (e.g. `site_hosts`).

<Aside>

  **NOTE:** Trellis is really powerful because it allows us to define multiple WordPress sites. If we wanted to host two sites on the same box, all we'd need to do is add another site to the `wordpress_sites` object.

</Aside>

Each site is identified by a key — in the example, the key is `example.com` — which allows us to link together our development, staging, and production environments without a bunch of duplicated configuration.

As a general rule, the production domain name is a good key to use.

With that in mind, let's set up our site by making the following changes to `wordpress_sites.yml`:

```diff
  wordpress_sites:
+   roots.code.lengstorf.com:
      site_hosts:
+       - canonical: roots.dev
-         redirects:
-           - www.example.dev
      local_path: ../site # path targeting local Bedrock site directory (relative to Ansible root)
+     admin_email: jason@lengstorf.com
      multisite:
        enabled: false
      ssl:
        enabled: false
        provider: self-signed
      cache:
        enabled: false

```

I'll be deploying the site to a production domain of `roots.code.lengstorf.com`, so that's my site key. For local development, we'll use `roots.dev` as the URL, and we don't need the `redirects` here, so we can remove them.

Finally, we updated the `admin_email`.

Save the changes and we're ready to move on.

### Add credentials to `vault.yml`.

Next, we'll open `trellis/group_vars/development/vault.yml`:

```yaml
# Documentation: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/vault/
vault_mysql_root_password: devpw

# Variables to accompany `group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml`
# Note: the site name (`example.com`) must match up with the site name in the above file.
vault_wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    admin_password: admin
    env:
      db_password: example_dbpassword
```

Here we can see that the site key is `example.com`, so we'll need to update that.

We also need to update `admin_password`, which is the password we'll use to log into WordPress's dashboard.

And finally, we'll add strong passwords for the MySQL root user and the site's DB access.

Make the following changes in `vault.yml`:

```diff
  # Documentation: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/vault/
+ vault_mysql_root_password: "xy&G6o2kKH$#AFz247N."

  # Variables to accompany `group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml`
  # Note: the site name (`example.com`) must match up with the site name in the   above file.
  vault_wordpress_sites:
+   roots.code.lengstorf.com:
+     admin_password: "DM93zj,o29KjT/bh$8G$"
      env:
+       db_password: "qP42q2*?hjt.P+x7Bzc6"
```

<Aside>

  **NOTE:** The passwords are quoted because of all the garbage characters in them. Without the quotes, the installer may choke on them.

</Aside>

Save the changes — now we're ready to fire up a local development box.

## Part IV: Start a Local Instance of the WordPress Site Using Vagrant

Here's where the power of Trellis starts to become apparent.

Assuming the required software is installed, only four steps are required to get to this point:

1. Clone Trellis.
2. Clone Bedrock.
3. Update `wordpress_sites.yaml`
4. Update `vault.yaml`

When you compare that to the "normal" WordPress setup — clone WordPress, create a database, configure your local `hosts` file to give you a development URL, and so on — Trellis is _far_ simpler. And we're not even to the really good stuff yet.

### Start the development site.

To start the development site, it's one simple command:

```bash
vagrant up
```

The first time you run this, it'll take a 5–10 minutes. This is because Vagrant needs to download and configure all the pieces required to get the box up and running properly. After the first time, a lot of dependencies will be cached, which makes things much quicker for subsequent calls to `vagrant up`.

### Check the development site on your local machine.

Once Vagrant is done, we can open the dev site by visiting `http://roots.dev/` in our browser.

<Image caption="The local instance of our WordPress site.">

  ![](./images/learn-roots-wordpress-01.jpg)

</Image>

### Log into the WordPress dashboard.

To log into the WordPress dashboard, head to `http://roots.dev/wp/wp-admin/` in your browser and use the `admin_password` we set in `vault.yml` earlier.

<Image caption="The WordPress dashboard after logging in.">

  ![](./images/learn-roots-wordpress-02.jpg)

</Image>

<Aside>

  **NOTE:** Bedrock keeps WordPress in a subdirectory, `wp/`, which helps us keep all of the WordPress core files separate from the rest of our app. This is helpful for managing the WordPress version with Composer.

</Aside>

## Part V: Configure a Production Server

Wait, what? We're already deploying to production?

Yep. That's how easy Trellis is.

### Create a Digital Ocean droplet to host the site.

It's hard to beat $5/month for hosting a website, so Digital Ocean will be our choice of production host.

<Aside>

  If you don't have a DigitalOcean account, you can get $10 of credit — that's enough to run this site for two months — by signing up using this link: [claim your $10 in DigitalOcean credit](https://m.do.co/c/9d561578e13a).

</Aside>

To get started, create or log into your DigitalOcean account, then create a new droplet.

Choose Ubuntu 16.04.1 x64 for the distribution, $5/mo for the size, and choose any datacenter region.

<Aside>

  **NOTE:** It's not technically required for this tutorial, but you should add your SSH key here as well. (If you're not sure how to do this, [GitHub has a great guide](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) on creating and finding SSH keys.)

</Aside>

### Update `hosts/production`.

To tell Trellis where the production server lives, we need to add its IP address to `trellis/hosts/production`.

```
# Add each host to the [production] group and to a "type" group such as [web] or [db].
# List each machine only once per [group], even if it will host multiple sites.

[production]
your_server_hostname

[web]
your_server_hostname
```

Make the following edits:

```diff
  # Add each host to the [production] group and to a "type" group such as [web] or [db].
  # List each machine only once per [group], even if it will host multiple sites.

  [production]
+ 162.243.171.188

  [web]
+ 162.243.171.188
```

### Enable free SSL and caching for production.

Setting up the production site configuration is nearly identical to the development site, except we need to add a few more settings for things like security. We can get these in place by editing `trellis/group_vars/production/wordpress_sites.yml`:

```yaml
# Documentation: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/remote-server-setup/
# `wordpress_sites` options: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/wordpress-sites
# Define accompanying passwords/secrets in group_vars/production/vault.yml

wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    site_hosts:
      - canonical: example.com
        redirects:
          - www.example.com
    local_path: ../site # path targeting local Bedrock site directory (relative to Ansible root)
    repo: git@github.com:example/example.com.git # replace with your Git repo URL
    repo_subtree_path: site # relative path to your Bedrock/WP directory in your repo
    branch: master
    multisite:
      enabled: false
    ssl:
      enabled: false
      provider: letsencrypt
    cache:
      enabled: false
```

Inside, make the following edits:

```diff
  # Documentation: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/remote-server-setup/
  # `wordpress_sites` options: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/wordpress-sites
  # Define accompanying passwords/secrets in group_vars/production/vault.yml

  wordpress_sites:
+   roots.code.lengstorf.com:
      site_hosts:
+       - canonical: roots.code.lengstorf.com
-         redirects:
-           - www.example.com
      local_path: ../site # path targeting local Bedrock site directory (relative to Ansible root)
+     repo: git@github.com:jlengstorf/roots.code.lengstorf.com.git # replace with your Git repo URL
      repo_subtree_path: site # relative path to your Bedrock/WP directory in your repo
      branch: master
      multisite:
        enabled: false
      ssl:
+       enabled: true
        provider: letsencrypt
      cache:
+       enabled: true
```

In addition to setting the site's URL, we also tell Trellis where the source code can be found with the `repo` setting, and enable SSL and caching for a faster, more secure site.

<Aside>

  **IMPORTANT:** You should _always_ enable SSL for a production site. First, Google is starting to penalize sites that don't use SSL in search engine results, and with a warning in the Chrome browser. Second, it's free and really, _really_ easy thanks to [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) — seriously, **the only thing you need to do to enable SSL is to change this setting.** No joke. So do it.

</Aside>

### Add security settings to `vault.yml`.

Next, we need to add passwords and encryption keys for the site. We do this by editing `trellis/group_vars/production/vault.yml`:

```yaml
# Documentation: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/vault/
vault_mysql_root_password: productionpw

# Documentation: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/security/
vault_users:
  - name: "{{ admin_user }}"
    password: example_password
    salt: "generateme"

# Variables to accompany `group_vars/production/wordpress_sites.yml`
# Note: the site name (`example.com`) must match up with the site name in the above file.
vault_wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    env:
      db_password: example_dbpassword
      # Generate your keys here: https://roots.io/salts.html
      auth_key: "generateme"
      secure_auth_key: "generateme"
      logged_in_key: "generateme"
      nonce_key: "generateme"
      auth_salt: "generateme"
      secure_auth_salt: "generateme"
      logged_in_salt: "generateme"
      nonce_salt: "generateme"
```

Make the following changes:

```diff
  # Documentation: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/vault/
+ vault_mysql_root_password: "z3Q6m3x8y?j@k&3+xuBq"

  # Documentation: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/security/
  vault_users:
    - name: "{{ admin_user }}"
+     password: "vH.827WQ2,t9?vyZyuB@"
+     salt: "jRMB764/EpB+,j(hvL98"

  # Variables to accompany `group_vars/production/wordpress_sites.yml`
  # Note: the site name (`example.com`) must match up with the site name in the above file.
  vault_wordpress_sites:
+   roots.code.lengstorf.com:
      env:
+       db_password: "#RLLE3)h9z9RDMT6d/4%"
        # Generate your keys here: https://roots.io/salts.html
+       auth_key: "&/qSrw23*@HeP2Kk#{^Ntx[!N>7#IdA=pCtI5gkpfgnn8{gDQ]2PQye]OkI.-p9f"

```

Note that you can automatically generate YAML-formatted encryption keys using [the Roots salt generator](https://roots.io/salts.html).

### Encrypt sensitive data with Ansible Vault.

Since it's _always_ a bad idea to commit plain text credentials in a repo, we're going to use [Ansible's built-in encryption](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_vault.html) to keep passwords and other sensitive data safe.

To do this, we create a password that will only be stored on our computer, which Ansible can use to decrypt the files. Trellis is already configured to ignore the password, so someone would need physical access to our computer to get the credentials.

<Aside>

  **NOTE:** I am _not_ a security expert. The Trellis team still recommends only committing Trellis configuration to private repositories, but `ansible-vault` is specifically designed to allow keeping sensitive data in source control — unless you've got numerous, well-funded, highly-motivated enemies, I'm fairly sure you'll be alright with encrypted files in a public repo. (If I'm wrong, please [create an issue and explain](https://github.com/jlengstorf/roots.code.lengstorf.com/issues) so I can update this article — and my worldview.)

</Aside>

#### Create a password for encrypting and decrypting files.

First, create a new file at `trellis/.vault_pass`:

```bash
# Make sure we’re in the `trellis/` directory
pwd
# Output => /Users/jlengstorf/dev/code.lengstorf.com/projects/learn-trellis/trellis

# Create a new file called `.vault_pass`
touch .vault_pass
```

Open `trellis/.vault_pass` for editing, then add a strong password:

```
Z+6Cm>TaofG=[379sED6
```

Save and close this file.

#### Update the Ansible config to use the vault password.

Open `trellis/ansible.cfg` for editing and add the highlighted line:

```diff
  [defaults]
  callback_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/callback_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/callback_plugins:lib/trellis/plugins/callback
  stdout_callback = output
  filter_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/filter_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/filter_plugins:lib/trellis/plugins/filter
  force_color = True
  force_handlers = True
  inventory = hosts
  nocows = 1
  roles_path = vendor/roles
  vars_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/vars_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/vars_plugins:lib/trellis/plugins/vars
+ vault_password_file = .vault_pass

  [ssh_connection]
  ssh_args = -o ForwardAgent=yes -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s
```

This tells Ansible where to look for the vault password, rather than prompting for it.

<Aside>

  **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT commit `.vault_pass` into source control, or the added security is worthless — anyone with `.vault_pass` can decrypt the Ansible files. Trellis already includes `.vault_pass` in its `.gitignore`, so this shouldn't be an issue.

</Aside>

#### Use `ansible-vault` to encrypt the files.

To actually encrypt the files, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/production/vault.yml
```

The output is a garbled mass of shit. This is a good thing — it means it's encrypted. Here's a snippet of what the encrypted file looks like:

```
$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256
62343434643862366430393366333661306366363937623561323637363033353366636134336230
3765633530336234393636306130346434333239636532650a336235356564303133303562626462
35363437383263653830313766646463646164303338626666366130396161383930373963613066

...
```

<Aside>

  **NOTE:** To edit the file, you can use `ansible-vault edit group_vars/production/vault.yml`, which allows you to make changes in the console using your default editor, or `ansible-vault decrypt group_vars/production/vault.yml`, which returns the file to its pre-encrypted state for editing wherever you want. **Don't forget to re-encrypt the file after editing.**

</Aside>

## Part VI: Provision the Production Server

Now that the proper configuration is in place, we need to let Trellis _provision_ — or configure — the production server. Before we can do that, we need to update a few more configuration options, then make sure our source code is in a public repo and our domain name points to the production server.

### Set up DNS so Let's Encrypt can run properly.

Since Let's Encrypt needs to verify the domain name in order to create an SSL certificate, we need to make sure the domain name points to the server _before_ we try to provision it. Otherwise, we'll get an error during the SSL step.

In your DNS manager of choice (typically the site you bought the domain name through, e.g. Namecheap or GoDaddy), **update the A record for your domain to point to your DigitalOcean droplet's IP address.**

<Image caption="The DNS record that points the subdomain to the Digital Ocean droplet.">

  ![](./images/learn-roots-wordpress-03.jpg)

</Image>

<Aside>

  **TIP:** You can also [configure your domain name using DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean) if you prefer.

</Aside>

<Aside>

  **NOTE:** Test that your domain is working by typing `ping <YOUR_DOMAIN>` in the console. The IP address in the output (e.g. `PING code.lengstorf.com (104.18.35.89): 56 data bytes`) should match your droplet.

</Aside>

### Use your GitHub keys for deployment.

To make sure cloning the repo on the production server goes smoothly, Ansible needs to know about your GitHub account's public keys.

Open `trellis/group_vars/all/users.yml` for editing, uncomment the GitHub URLs, and edit them to reflect your GitHub username:

```diff
# Documentation: https://roots.io/trellis/docs/ssh-keys/
admin_user: admin

  # Also define 'vault_users' (`group_vars/staging/vault.yml`, `group_vars/production/vault.yml`)
  users:
    - name: "{{ web_user }}"
      groups:
        - "{{ web_group }}"
      keys:
        - "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
+       # IMPORTANT: Add YOUR GitHub username here.
+       - https://github.com/jlengstorf.keys
    - name: "{{ admin_user }}"
      groups:
        - sudo
      keys:
        - "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
+       # IMPORTANT: Add YOUR GitHub username here.
+       - https://github.com/jlengstorf.keys

  web_user: web
  web_group: www-data
  web_sudoers:
    - "/usr/sbin/service php7.0-fpm *"
```

### Disable root login for better security.

This step is optional, but unless you have a _really_ good reason to keep the root user enabled, it's a good idea to disable it. The root user can wreak havoc on a server, so we can sleep better knowing that it's disabled and can't hurt anyone anymore.

### Commit the site's code to GitHub.

For this tutorial, I created a repo called [roots.code.lengstorf.com](https://github.com/jlengstorf/roots.code.lengstorf.com). You'll want to create your own for this step.

To get our site's code up to that repo, run the following commands:

```bash
# Move to the project root
cd ..
pwd
# Output => /Users/jlengstorf/dev/code.lengstorf.com/projects/learn-trellis

# Initialize a Git repository.
git init

# Add all the files to the repo.
git add -A

# Commit the files.
git commit -m 'Initial commit.'

# Add the GitHub repo as a remote repository.
# IMPORTANT: Replace this with YOUR GitHub repository!
git remote add origin git@github.com:jlengstorf/roots.code.lengstorf.com.git

# Push the `master` branch to GitHub and set it up for tracking.
git push --set-upstream origin master
```

### Run the server provisioning script.

With the repo ready, the DNS configured, and some security measures in place, we're ready to provision the server.

Provisioning means getting the server ready: Ansible will run through a series of commands that download, install, and configure our server based on the information we've provided in the configuration files.

To make it happen, all we need to do is run the following:

```bash
# Move into the Trellis directory.
cd trellis/

# Provision the server using the `production` configuration options.
ansible-playbook server.yml -e env=production
```

This takes about 5–10 minutes. The output in the command line walks through everything that's being installed and configured, so if you're curious you can follow along and see what the Roots maintainers consider best practices for server configuration.

Or, we can walk away and let the robots do our bidding.

When it's all done, we'll see a "play recap" from Ansible that looks something like this:

```
PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
162.243.171.188            : ok=130  changed=93   unreachable=0    failed=0
localhost                  : ok=0    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

With 0 failures, we're ready to deploy!

## Part VII: Deploy the Site to Production

Our last step — deploying our WordPress site to the DigitalOcean droplet — is _really fucking easy_ — even compared to the rest of the steps in this walkthrough. We've already configured everything. We've already committed all our site's files to GitHub. We've already provisioned a server.

Now we just need Ansible to copy the site files and fire it up.

Enter the following to make it happen:

```bash
# Make sure we're in the `trellis/` directory.
pwd
# Output => /Users/jlengstorf/dev/code.lengstorf.com/projects/learn-trellis/trellis

# Deploy the `roots.code.lengstorf.com` site using `production` options.
# NOTE: Replace this site key with YOUR site key.
./bin/deploy.sh production roots.code.lengstorf.com
```

This takes a minute or two, and ends with a "play recap", just like provisioning. It should look something like this:

```
PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
162.243.171.188            : ok=27   changed=12   unreachable=0    failed=0
localhost                  : ok=0    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

<Aside>

  **NOTE:** At the time of recording, the deploy script was at the root of the Trellis directory. The command has been updated in this article, but not in the video.

</Aside>

### Check the Live Site

And that's it. **We've successfully deployed an SSL-secured (for free), painlessly-source-controlled WordPress site on a live domain name, all for about 20 minutes and $5/month.**

## BONUS: Synchronize Databases Using WP Sync DB

Trellis only manages files, so you'll notice that the new site doesn't match up with the development site. This isn't a big deal when you first start out, but as the production site starts to grow and the content builds up, it's a pain in the ass to pull a copy of the database so you can develop using real data.

Fortunately, the free plugin [WP Sync DB](https://github.com/wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db) makes synchronizing databases really painless. So let's install that and try it out.

### Install WP Sync DB on the site.

Since we're using Bedrock, installing the plugin is as simple as telling Composer we want to use it.

```bash
# Make sure we’re in the site/ directory.
cd ../site
pwd
# Output => /Users/dev/code.lengstorf.com/projects/learn-trellis/site

# Use Composer to install WP Sync DB
composer require wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db:dev-master@dev

# Use Composer to install the media attachments plugin for WP Sync DB
composer require wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db-media-files:dev-master
```

<Aside>

  **NOTE:** The `:dev-master@dev` is required because WP Sync DB doesn't specify a stable version, which causes Composer to complain if we're not _very specific_ about getting the development branch.

</Aside>

### Commit and redeploy to production.

After WP Sync DB is installed, we need to get it installed on the production server. This is a good example of how easy it is to deploy changes using Trellis: if you run `git status`, you'll see that `composer.json` and `composer.lock` have been updated; simply commit and push those files, then redeploy to production.

```bash
# Commit the changes and push them.
git commit -Am 'feat(wp-sync-db): installed WP Sync DB'
git push

# Deploy the changes to production.
cd ../trellis
./bin/deploy.sh production roots.code.lengstorf.com
```

### Activate WP Sync DB on the production site and get the API key.

Once the deploy is complete, go to the production site's WordPress dashboard (e.g. `https://roots.code.lengstorf.com/wp/wp-admin/`), log in, then click "Plugins" in the left-hand menu.

Activate both the "WP Sync DB" and "WP Sync DB Media Files" plugins, then navigate to "Tools", then "Migrate DB" in the left-hand menu.

Click the "Settings" tab, then do the following:

<Image caption="The WP Sync DB plugin on the live site.">

  ![](./images/learn-roots-wordpress-05.jpg)

</Image>

1. Check the "Accept **push** requests..." option.
2. Copy the link in the "Connection Info" box.

Now the plugin is able to receive a database update from an external site (our development site, in this example).

### Activate WP Sync DB on the development site and configure the sync.

On your development site, head to the "Plugins" page on your WordPress dashboard to activate the WP Sync DB and WP Sync DB Media Files plugins, then navigate to Tools > Migrate DB.

On the "Migrate" tab, update the settings as shown:

<Image caption="Settings for the WP Sync DB plugin on the development site.">

  ![](./images/learn-roots-wordpress-06.jpg)

</Image>

1. Choose the "Push" option.
2. Paste the production site's connection info into the text area that appears (what we copied in the previous step).
3. Under Advanced options:
    - Uncheck the "Replace GUIDs" option.
    - Check the "exclude spam comments" option.
4. [OPTIONAL] Check the "Backup the remote database before replacing it" option. This is probably a good idea if the production site has real data on it.
5. Check the "Media Files" option.
6. [OPTIONAL] Check the "Save Migration Profile" option and create a name so you can quickly push changes to production.

Once all these settings have been updated, click the "Migrate DB & Save" button.

Once this is done, you can reload the production site and see that the database from the development site is now live on production.

<Aside>

  **IMPORTANT:** The default database migration moves everything, including the `wp_users` table. This means that the username and password of the WordPress users are also migrated. So after migrating from development to production, the development username and password now logs into production as well. This is extremely important if your development credentials are available unencrypted in Trellis (you can solve this with `ansible-vault`).
