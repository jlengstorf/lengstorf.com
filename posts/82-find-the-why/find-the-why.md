In some of my [previous](/right-thing-easy-thing) [posts](/balance-for-first-year-entrepreneurs), I use the phrase **“Find the Why”** as a kind of shorthand for the process of digging deeper into our behaviors, feelings, and ideas to figure out what’s _really_ going on.[^prior-art]

[^prior-art]:
    This isn’t a new or novel concept: the [Five Whys](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/five-whys.html) was put into practice by Toyota decades ago; companies have been conducting [root cause analyses](https://smartbear.com/learn/performance-monitoring/what-is-root-cause-analysis/) for longer. This article is my interpretation of a widely used practice for ensuring that problems are solved for realsies.

I want to dig into what I mean by that, and offer up **a framework for Finding the Why on your own.**

## Why Is Finding the Why Important?

Not too long ago, I was in a [retrospective](/2017-personal-retrospective) for a project, and there were a few things that had just plain failed to work. After collecting everyone’s opinion on what went wrong, I started asking _why_ things went wrong.

Someone interrupted me and said, “It doesn’t matter _why_ it went wrong; we need to focus on how we’re going to fix it.”

In certain circumstances, I can see the point: if your pants catch fire, you should focus on putting out the fire, not asking whether the blaze happened because you are, in fact, a liar liar.

The problem with only solving the problem, though, is that **problems are often just a symptom of something deeper.**

**If we don’t understand _why_ the problem occurred, we have no way of knowing if our fix has actually solved the problem**, or just temporarily covered it up.

## How Will Finding the Why Help?

By taking the time to examine the underlying causes of problems, we gain subtle but **extremely powerful advantages.**

### We become proactive instead of reactive.

There are a few people I work with on a daily basis who stress me out just to be around. Their entire existence, as far as I can tell, is spent careening from one fire to the next, desparately trying to stay on top of an endless stream of fire drills.

This is a **reactive approach**, and it looks like a waking nightmare.

If you’re living reactively, the world is constantly happening _to you_. Chaos reigns, and every problem is a surprise. It’s like a game of whack-a-mole, except you’re the one taking all the lumps.

If, however, you take a **proactive approach**, life starts to look a little different: because you’re making the effort to understand _why_ problems are occurring, you start to see patterns. Problems that previously felt novel start to resemble each other, and you can apply your previous experience to help solve new problems more effectively.

The real advantage to a proactive approach, however, is that your deeper understanding allows you to [see problems before they happen](/see-tree-coming). Because you’ve worked out the underlying cause of previous problems, you can spot problematic things and correct them _before_ anything breaks.

### We can find patterns that make problems easier to solve.

By thinking through to the deeper causes of our problems, we can start to see that **a whole lot of problems share similar root causes**.

Part of my job is building processes and tools to make teams more effective. When I first started looking at the bottlenecks and time drains our teams were up against, they seemed like unrelated challenges — this made it feel like the effort was doomed.

After researching to Find the Why, however, we found a few common culprits:

 -  There was a lack of clarity about goals, so teams were being forced to make 
    educated guesses about what was expected of them.
 -  People were being asked to do things that fell way outside of their job
    descriptions and/or comfort zones.
 -  Many core pieces of information were completely undocumented, meaning teams
    had to wait for the one or two people who understood it to have time to help them.

**These three problems were causing the vast majority of the bottlenecks, performance problems, interpersonal conflicts, and other issues we were trying to solve.** By realizing this, we were able to focus our efforts in a way that actually made an impact.

Had we instead looked at these as unique technical, tooling, personnel, and individual problems, we would have wasted a huge amount of effort treating the symptoms — and wouldn’t have made much progress.

### Sometimes noticing is all it takes.

When people start working with nutritionists or dieticians, a really common first step is to ask them to write down everything they eat throughout the day. And in many cases, this simple act causes people to make improvements in their diet.

I ask something similar of myself and the people I coach: take note of where your time goes during the day.[^productivity]

[^productivity]:
    If you’re interested, I have a whole write-up on [how I keep myself productive](/scheduling-maximum-productivity) that goes into more detail on this.

**When we’re paying attention, we tend to make better choices.**

If we take the time to Find the Why behind our problems, we’re able to notice when something has the potential to become problematic.

If you’ve ever burned out an electric motor,[^juicer] you probably now know that there are certain sounds and smells that mean something’s about to go horribly wrong. By recognizing that, you’re able to turn off the machine _before_ an expensive failure happens.

[^juicer]:
    I mean, _I’ve_ never done that, of course, but I have this friend who may have tried to cram a few too many carrots into a juicer and learned _all about_ the intricacies of its manufacturer warranty.

Sometimes that’s all it takes to eliminate problems.

## How Do You Find the Why?

### 1. When you notice a problem, pause and assess the situation.

TK

### 2. Pay attention to the symptoms.

TK

### 3. Think about why it happened.

### 4. Ask why again.

### 5. Keep asking until you’ve reached the deepest reason you can control.
