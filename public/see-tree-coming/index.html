<p>When I fail, I&rsquo;m presented with a choice: do I learn nothing, learn one thing, or learn a life lesson?</p>

<p>Maybe that sounds ridiculous. Of <em>course</em> I should learn a life lesson, right?</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, at least, learning something valuable from failure hasn&rsquo;t always been easy.</p>

<h2 id="the-treadmill-treadmill:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944">The Treadmill Treadmill</h2>

<p>Let me try to explain with a story:</p>

<p>I struggled for years to stay consistent with my trips to the gym. I would get inspired, find a workout program, pick a diet plan, write a detailed daily fitness agenda, and start planning how I&rsquo;d handle the dozens of beautiful women who would undoubtedly be throwing themselves at me in the coming weeks.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944:new-life"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944:new-life">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But, despite my initial optimism, I&rsquo;d find myself feeling discouraged, making excuses, and eventually abandoning the whole idea.</p>

<p>I was failing. And I was being presented with a choice.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-five-times-i-failed-in-exactly-the-same-way:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944">The First Five Times I Failed In Exactly the Same Way</h2>

<p>At first, I made the choice to learn nothing.</p>

<p>I made excuses. I blamed external circumstances. I tried to convince myself that I was just better off ignoring my health.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d brush it off, the memory would fade, and eventually I&rsquo;d start the cycle over again &ndash; only to fail in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>I was learning nothing, and it showed in my embarrassing lack of progress.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-five-times-i-failed-creatively:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944">The Next Five Times I Failed Creatively</h2>

<p>After I recognized that I was stuck in a loop, I started choosing to learn one thing.</p>

<p>First, I learned that I wasn&rsquo;t very good at working out first thing in the morning. Then I learned I couldn&rsquo;t always make the afternoons work. After that I discovered that I couldn&rsquo;t sustain a chicken-and-steamed-broccoli diet like my bodybuilder friends.</p>

<p>Each time I failed again, I was learning one thing &ndash; one precise set of circumstances &ndash; that led to my failure.</p>

<h2 id="the-last-time-i-failed-i-learned:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944">The Last Time I Failed, I Learned</h2>

<p>After repeating this cycle maybe a dozen times, I finally took a step back and thought about my situation.</p>

<p>Here I was, trying to stay consistent with a plan to make myself healthier &ndash; what better motivation is there? &ndash; and somehow <em>I was failing every time.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d learned lots of &ldquo;one thing&rdquo; lessons, but I&rsquo;d never taken the time to examine the root of the issue.</p>

<p><strong>I was treating the symptoms instead of the disease.</strong></p>

<p>So I analyzed, and I ultimately came to the conclusion that the common thread in all my failures was that I gave up after I started to fail: if I missed a workout or had some ice cream, I felt like I&rsquo;d ruined everything and just gave up.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m an &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; type. So when I made a plan, I had to execute it flawlessly or I was wasting my time.</p>

<p>So I learned a life lesson: <strong>I need to set my bar low enough that I can always hit my goal.</strong></p>

<p>My plans started out as, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do this huge workout and eat exactly these things.&rdquo; The simple lowering of that bar to, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do something active every day and make sure I eat vegetables with every meal,&rdquo; has made it possible for me to always hit my goal, and as a result I&rsquo;ve stayed consistent for nearly a year now.</p>

<p>To clarify, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that I set low expectations that allow me to skate by. I&rsquo;m just adjusting the definition of &ldquo;success&rdquo; so that I can sustainably hit my goals. If my goal is &ldquo;just get to the gym, even if you show up, turn around, and go back home,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve set the bar really low. However, while I&rsquo;ve been to the gym and done a less-than-stellar workout, I&rsquo;ve never showed up to the gym and done <em>nothing</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944:starting"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944:starting">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m no picture of perfect human health or anything, but I <em>can</em> climb stairs without wheezing and I don&rsquo;t have any aches or pains &ndash; that&rsquo;s all I really need to feel like I&rsquo;m taking care of myself.</p>

<h2 id="finding-the-source:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944">Finding the Source</h2>

<p>Aside from the obvious benefit to my physical well-being, dealing with my failures taught me one of the most useful life skills I&rsquo;ve come across yet:</p>

<p><strong>When you fail, try to understand <em>why</em> you failed instead of just learning how to avoid repeating this one mistake.</strong></p>

<p>If I run into a tree, I shouldn&rsquo;t just glare at the tree and then go about my day.</p>

<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t just make a note of where the tree is so I can avoid it next time I pass this way.</p>

<p>Instead, I should try to understand why I didn&rsquo;t see the tree coming in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="in-practice:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944">In Practice</h2>

<p>Beyond my fitness goals, this approach to failure has helped me in every area of my life.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s helped me understand that when I lose clients, it&rsquo;s not because that client is beyond help or because I worded something incorrectly; it&rsquo;s because I violated their expectations, which put them on edge and started a downward spiral.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s helped me understand that when I end up fighting with my girlfriend, it&rsquo;s not because she&rsquo;s irrational or because I&rsquo;m too detached; it&rsquo;s because I made her feel attacked, or unimportant, or a similarly unsavory emotion.</p>

<p>This applies to dozens of other examples that I could have brushed past as one-off incidents (or worse, forgotten entirely). Each failure gives me a little window into how I&rsquo;m perceived by others, or how I&rsquo;m wired, and it allows me to &ldquo;hack&rdquo; my personality &ndash; I can see certain trees coming and avoid them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll hit hundreds more trees &ndash; thousands even &ndash; as I continue to grow and learn and fail, but if I&rsquo;m doing this right, they won&rsquo;t be the same trees all that often.</p>

<li id="fn:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944:new-life">I had this all worked out: there would be a reality show where these women would showcase their intelligence, strength, and wit through a Billy Madison-esque decathlon featuring such events as &ldquo;Carry Me Up the Stairs as if I&rsquo;ve Been Injured&rdquo; and &ldquo;Write Me a Haiku About Bears&rdquo;. There would be laughter, tears, strategy, and a Final Challenge that probably involved the Nerf guns from <em>American Gladiators</em>. The series would be met with lackluster reviews, but a strong cult following.

<li id="fn:651429ecea821716f8554d03d68d6944:starting">The big difference here is <em>framing</em>. Before, when I was failing, doing a quick workout because I wasn&rsquo;t feeling 100% would constitute a failure; now, I look at <em>any</em> workout being better than no workout. Get it?

          I&rsquo;m Jason Lengstorf: an author, speaker, and digital nomad.
        </h2>
        <div class="footer-about__copy">
          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
