<p>If you write down everything you have to get done for you to do your job well, what does the list look like?</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re like most of us, <strong>your list of duties will have a wide variety of tasks that require different kinds of attention and focus.</strong> We have to play multiple roles: communicator, planner, creator, administrator.</p>

<p>Each of these roles requires different skills, and different parts of our brains.</p>

<p>For example, when we check email, jump into the work chat, or scan social media, we&rsquo;re working in the context of communication. Research and learning are in the context of information gathering. Design, development, and writing are in the context of creation.</p>

<p>If we spend a little time looking at our list of duties, we&rsquo;ll start to see that <strong>our jobs expect us to work across multiple contexts to get things done.</strong></p>

<p>The variety of jobs we&rsquo;re expected to do adds a new challenge for us: we have to shift gears in order to get our work done. And while we all know that constantly shifting gears slows us down in our work — in the same way we <em>know</em> that we should exercise more, and we <em>know</em> seeing the movie based on a book we love will let us down — we don&rsquo;t do much to fix the problem.</p>

<p>And it turns out, trying to do all the different jobs at the same time is a <em>big</em> problem.</p>

<h3 id="i-used-to-be-terrible-at-working:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">I Used to Be Terrible at Working</h3>

<p>When I first started freelancing — and worse, when I started hiring subcontractors and employees — I was <em>awful</em> at getting things done effectively. I felt tremendous pressure to be everything to everyone: if I wasn&rsquo;t available on Slack, I was holding up my team; if I didn&rsquo;t respond to an email within an hour, my clients would hire someone else; if I didn&rsquo;t finish a project by the deadline, I&rsquo;d lose the project.</p>

<p>This led to a horribly <a href="http://lengstorf.com/overkill-cult/">unsustainable working style</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before my eyes are even open I&rsquo;m reaching for my phone. The lock screen is loaded with notifications, and a knot starts to form in my stomach. <em>Oh Christ. Here we go again.</em> Scan the email for emergencies. Check Twitter. <em>Only 1 new follower. Note to self: suck less as a person.</em> More email. Mash out typo-riddled responses with my thumbs as I walk to get coffee — &ldquo;Hey, Heidi. Nice day, huh? &hellip; Yeah, I&rsquo;m good. You? &hellip; Good to hear. Well, see you later!&rdquo; — and scan calendar invites on the walk back. Open a code editor. Chat beeps. Forget what I was working on. Remember. Email beeps. Forget again. Start working on the issue in the email. Chat beeps. Remember what I was supposed to be working on. Email beeps. Forget. Look at the clock. <em>Goddammit, I forgot to eat again.</em> Order delivery. Move to the couch. Put on <em>Fringe</em>. Remember today&rsquo;s deadline. Panic. It&rsquo;s after nine so chat&rsquo;s quiet; <em>finally, I&rsquo;ll get some work done.</em> Close the computer with four half-finished emails and two of three projects incomplete. Fall asleep checking email.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Most days, I <em>did</em> a lot — I just didn&rsquo;t get much *done.</strong>*</p>

<p>Most of my time was spent on things that weren&rsquo;t very important, and very little of my effort was spent on what I was <em>supposed</em> to be doing.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, about 75% of my working hours were lost to fumbling between tasks and trying to ward off the onslaught of realtime communication with all the sad determination of a cartoon character plugging holes in a sinking boat with his fingers.</p>

<p>My target for each week is to spend fewer than 40 hours on the computer <em>total,</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:computertime"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:computertime">1</a></sup> so I needed to be <em>way</em> better at this if I wasn&rsquo;t going to end up jobless.</p>

<h2 id="the-productivity-supercharger-separate-tasks-by-context:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">The Productivity Supercharger: Separate Tasks by Context</h2>

<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/philcaravaggio">Phil Caravaggio</a> is one of those people who optimizes everything. It&rsquo;s necessary for his job — he&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.precisionnutrition.com/about/phil-caravaggio">CEO of Precision Nutrition</a>, a multi-million dollar company — if he&rsquo;s going to live a life outside the requirements of the company.</p>

<p>Phil introduced me to <a href="http://www.entrepreneurship.org/resource-center/the-entrepreneurial-time-system-t.aspx">Dan Sullivan&rsquo;s time management ideas</a>, which center around context. He has a trademarked approach to time management called The Entrepreneurial Time System™ that&rsquo;s worth looking into.</p>

<p>Phil has implemented this system into his working style with <em>massive</em> success. Encouraged by Phil&rsquo;s experience, I decided to try out the broad strokes of the system in my own planning.</p>

<p>In simple terms: <strong>the best way to maximize your productivity is to separate tasks by context.</strong></p>

<p>We have three kinds of tasks as entrepreneurs: high-impact tasks that require all of our attention and produce big results; regenerative tasks that allow us to recharge and let our subconscious work on new solutions and ideas; and low-impact tasks that just have to be done in order to allow us to perform the high-impact tasks.</p>

<p>If we group these tasks into three kinds of days, we get Meaningful Work Days, Off Days, and Bullshit<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:bullshit"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:bullshit">2</a></sup> Days. (For fun and brevity, we&rsquo;ll call this the MOB System.)<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:sullivan"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:sullivan">3</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="meaningful-work-days-focus-exclusively-on-big-tasks:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">Meaningful Work Days: Focus Exclusively on Big Tasks</h3>

<p><strong>Meaningful work days are reserved for high-impact work only.</strong> The act of actually writing, developing, or designing something after all the preparatory work is done. If working is an episode of <em>MTV Cribs</em>, Meaningful Work Days are the bedroom, because, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuEdZVV6XHw&amp;t=3m0s">&ldquo;This is where the magic happens.&rdquo;</a></p>

<h3 id="off-days-relax-recharge-let-your-mind-wander:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">Off Days: Relax, Recharge, Let Your Mind Wander</h3>

<p><strong>Off days are technology-free.</strong> Or at least work-free. I aim to have at least one day a week where my computer isn&rsquo;t opened at all, and I use that day to do something adventurous, like <a href="https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/588879515067097088">heading out to a water fight</a> or taking Thai cooking lessons.</p>

<h3 id="bullshit-days-prep-work-busywork-chores:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">Bullshit Days: Prep Work, Busywork, Chores</h3>

<p><strong>Bullshit days are for all the things that are required for us to do our important tasks,</strong> but that aren&rsquo;t necessarily the sexy parts of the job that we look forward to. This can include email, accounting, research, outlining, setting up development environments, or collecting inspiration for a new design.</p>

<h2 id="all-three-days-are-necessary-for-maximum-productivity:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">All Three Days Are Necessary for Maximum Productivity</h2>

<p>It may be tempting to think, &ldquo;Since all the best results come from Meaningful Work Days, why don&rsquo;t I <em>only</em> have Meaningful Work Days?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are two problems with this kind of thinking.</p>

<h3 id="1-all-work-and-no-play-makes-you-suck-at-work:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">1. All Work and No Play Makes You Suck at Work</h3>

<p>It turns out that human brains just aren&rsquo;t all that good at sustained periods of focus. We can cram for a while, but it&rsquo;s a game of diminishing returns.</p>

<p><strong>If we try to force focus days every day, we&rsquo;ll eventually end up hurting ourselves.</strong> <a href="http://lengstorf.com/overtime-hurts-productivity/">Too much time on the job results in less output at lower quality</a> than if we&rsquo;d kept a more balanced schedule.</p>

<p>Off Days create mental space where <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/want-to-be-more-creative-take-a-walk/">our subconscious can form new ideas</a>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:walking"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:walking">4</a></sup> They create distance from the job, which allows us to <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090511180702.htm">remember what&rsquo;s important to us</a>. They <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/08/schedule-a-15-minute-break-before-you-burn-out/">keeps us from burning out</a>.</p>

<h3 id="2-hard-work-without-preparation-is-wasted:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">2. Hard Work Without Preparation Is Wasted</h3>

<p>Very few meaningful tasks can happen in a vacuum.</p>

<p>To write a good article, there&rsquo;s prior reading to be done, research to be collected, interviews to be conducted, and various other prep tasks that need to be completed.</p>

<p>Similarly, to design something for a client, resources need to be collected, the requirements need to be gathered from the client, and marketing content needs to be approved.</p>

<p>Without doing the prep beforehand, you&rsquo;ll have to do it while trying to complete the task. And there&rsquo;s no better way to end up down a Wikipedia Hole and accomplish nothing than to try to do research for an article as you write it.</p>

<p><strong>If we want to be effective on our Meaningful Work Days, we need to have all the bullshit out of the way first.</strong> Without proper prep work, a Meaningful Work Day becomes a Bullshit Day instead.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-split-up-your-todo-list:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">How to Split Up Your Todo List</h2>

<p>To start MOB-bing,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:ha"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:ha">5</a></sup> you need to go through two critical steps. Schedule these for your first Bullshit Day.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Write down <em>everything</em> you do for your job.</strong> If it happens while you&rsquo;re at work, write it down.</li>
<li><strong>Separate your tasks into &ldquo;Meaningful&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bullshit&rdquo; categories.</strong> What makes a <em>big</em> impact in your job? What just needs to be done to get you to the next big task?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="meaningful-tasks:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">Meaningful Tasks</h3>

<p><strong>Meaningful tasks are the things that make the biggest impact,</strong> and that take the most concentration. If we&rsquo;re in a job we love — or even a job we just <em>like</em>-like — these are probably the things we enjoy doing the most.</p>

<p>For me, meaningful tasks are writing, development, and design. I get a big emotional payoff from these jobs, and they make the biggest impact on my career.</p>

<h3 id="bullshit-tasks:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">Bullshit Tasks</h3>

<p><strong>Bullshit tasks are the tasks that have to be taken care of for the meaningful work to have meaning.</strong> Tasks like these aren&rsquo;t necessarily exciting, but they lay the groundwork for the fun stuff.</p>

<p>For me, bullshit tasks are research, editing, email, billing, and code maintenance. I don&rsquo;t feel particularly enamored with this stuff, but I know that it needs to be done so I can keep the lights on and create more opportunities for my more enjoyable tasks.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-give-yourself-permission-and-space-to-improve-your-scheduling:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">How to Give Yourself Permission and Space to Improve Your Scheduling</h2>

<p><strong>The idea of taking full days away from email and chat to focus on the most meaningful work may seem impossible.</strong> &ldquo;Sure, <em>you</em> can do that,&rdquo; you may be thinking, &ldquo;but I have [clients/coworkers/managers/customers] to consider. I can&rsquo;t just <em>not</em> check email for a full day.&rdquo;<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:meaningfulmorning"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:meaningfulmorning">6</a></sup></p>

<p>I felt the same way before I started.</p>

<p>At the time, my agency was growing: I had over a hundred clients, a half-dozen employees and contractors, editors, and conference producers, and all of them had questions, problems, and needs that required my attention.</p>

<p>I was <em>absolutely positive</em> that if I wasn&rsquo;t 100% available, everything would fall apart around me.</p>

<p><strong>Thankfully, my concerns were *absolutely wrong.</strong>*</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I was able to make the switch, and how you can, too.</p>

<h3 id="1-start-with-a-plan:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">1. Start with a Plan</h3>

<p>Meaningful work days can only happen after you get the bullshit — planning, gathering resources, asking questions — out of the way first. Otherwise, you&rsquo;re dead in the water.</p>

<p><strong>Use a Bullshit Day to write out all the tasks on your plate.</strong> Then break them down into smaller steps and figure out what needs to be done before you can focus on the meat of the task: if you&rsquo;re on the hook for an article, you&rsquo;ll need to research other articles on the topic, find studies that back up your points, and write an outline before you can start writing.</p>

<p>If you try to start without doing the initial prep work, trying to do meaningful work becomes more challenging and — most likely — less productive.</p>

<h3 id="2-let-everyone-know-what-s-happening:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">2. Let Everyone Know What&rsquo;s Happening</h3>

<p>The week before I started using the MOB System, I told my team that I was going to start spending three days a week on Meaningful Work Days. <strong>This meant on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, everyone would be entirely unable to reach me.</strong></p>

<p><strong>To prepare my team,</strong> I set clear expectations that &ldquo;needing my input&rdquo; was not a valid excuse for missed deadlines. If they needed me, they needed to get in touch <em>before</em> my Meaningful Work Days.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:empowered"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:empowered">7</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>To prepare my clients,</strong> I created an autoresponder saying I only checked email on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and that they could route their requests to our general email if the request was urgent.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:bottleneck"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:bottleneck">8</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>By being upfront and very clear with both my team and my clients, no one was blindsided by my changed schedule.</strong> As a result, no one seemed to be particularly bothered or slowed down. I honestly don&rsquo;t think anyone noticed most of the time.</p>

<p><strong>I hadn&rsquo;t realized it before, but by making myself fully available at all times, I had actually made my team and clients <em>worse</em> at things.</strong> I was a crutch. A shortcut. As soon as I made myself less available, they stopped looking to me for approval or help.</p>

<p>They remembered their own power and competence, and as a result they <em>got things done.</em></p>

<h3 id="3-remove-all-distractions:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">3. Remove All Distractions</h3>

<p><strong>Getting work done means giving yourself a period of <em>uninterrupted</em> time during which you can focus exclusively on the task at hand.</strong></p>

<p>If your phone is vibrating every few seconds, or the work chat is chiming non-stop, you&rsquo;re not working uninterrupted.</p>

<p>Use &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; mode, or turn off your network connection entirely. Turn your phone face down and silence the ringer and vibration.</p>

<p>If you have trouble avoiding distracting sites, use something like <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/ref/967986">RescueTime</a> to block sites temporarily.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:blockers"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359:blockers">9</a></sup></p>

<p>If you work in an office, find a space where you can avoid coworker interruptions. If all else fails, put on headphones and hang a sign off your back that says, &ldquo;Unless the building is on fire, please don&rsquo;t interrupt me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(Or, even better, <a href="http://lengstorf.com/convince-your-boss-remote-work/">convince your boss to let you work remotely</a>.)</p>

<p>However you do it, find a way to buy yourself two blocks of 2–3 hours, at least twice a week.</p>

<p><strong>If your boss has any interest in results, your extra productivity will be noticed quickly, and you&rsquo;ll find yourself being <em>protected</em> from distractions.</strong></p>

<h3 id="4-use-a-timer:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">4. Use a Timer</h3>

<p>Using a timer is critical, because without one we&rsquo;re bound to run over our allotted time slots. I use a simple app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-cup-noodle-timer/id423076135?mt=12">Pocket Cup Noodle Timer</a> to keep track of my work blocks.</p>

<p>I like 90-minute cycles because it&rsquo;s supported by research into <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tony-schwartz/work-life-balance-the-90_b_578671.html">our bodies&rsquo; natural rhythms</a>.</p>

<p>Another popular approach with shorter working bursts is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>.</p>

<h3 id="5-follow-a-simple-schedule:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">5. Follow a Simple Schedule</h3>

<p>Scheduling is a touchy subject for me. I hate it when people tell me how to spend my own time. So let me be very clear that <strong>this section is just a suggestion</strong>, based on my own experience.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing particularly groundbreaking about the way I schedule my days. The difference, really, is in the <em>types of work</em> being scheduled.</p>

<p><strong>The secret for me has been concentrated bursts of work, punctuated with full disconnection for short breaks.</strong></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the general scheduling template I follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>90-minute timed work block</li>
<li>15-minute technology- and work-free break</li>
<li>90-minute timed work block</li>
<li>60-minute lunch</li>
<li>90-minute timed work block</li>
<li>75-minute technology- and work-free break</li>
<li>90-minute timed work block</li>
</ul>

<p>This is 7.5 total hours of work, with 6 hours of screen time.</p>

<h3 id="6-take-real-breaks:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">6. Take Real Breaks</h3>

<p><strong>Short <a href="http://lengstorf.com/better-productivity-work-less/">breaks are vital for staying productive</a> because, according to science, <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/08/schedule-a-15-minute-break-before-you-burn-out/">taking breaks keeps us focused</a>.</strong></p>

<p>And if you use your break to take a walk, you can <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/want-to-be-more-creative-take-a-walk/?_r=0">boost your creativity</a> and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/6094786/Feeling-stressed-Then-go-mow-the-lawn-claims-research.html">lower your stress levels</a>.</p>

<p>Just make sure to leave your technology behind. No phone checks, and leave your laptop closed. Take your breaks like it&rsquo;s 1991 and phones are only used for talking to people far away.</p>

<h3 id="7-when-you-re-done-be-done:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">7. When You&rsquo;re Done, Be Done</h3>

<p>Each day starts with your todo list. Let&rsquo;s say your goals for the day are to clear your inbox, edit a blog post, and fix a bug in the website; when you&rsquo;ve finished the list, write your todo list for tomorrow, then <em>stop working for the day.</em></p>

<p>If you only need three of the four 90-minute working blocks, be okay with stopping early. <strong>Productivity is measured in results, not how many hours your butt is in a chair.</strong></p>

<p>(More on this: <a href="http://lengstorf.com/results-based-work/">How Time-Based Management Kills Motivation</a>)</p>

<h2 id="better-productivity-means-a-little-discipline-now-and-a-lot-of-freedom-later:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">Better Productivity Means a Little Discipline Now and a Lot of Freedom Later</h2>

<p>Understanding the role context plays in our work — and its extreme effects on our productivity — is helpful, but it won&rsquo;t make much of a difference if the knowledge isn&rsquo;t applied.</p>

<p><strong>All the knowledge in the world means jack if we don&rsquo;t change after we know better.</strong></p>

<p>The initial challenge of guarding our time can seem daunting. Our coworkers have grown used to the way we work <em>now</em> — changing that seems like it could cause tension.</p>

<p>In all fairness, it might. But only at first.</p>

<p><strong>In a healthy workplace, both management and the workers value results.</strong> By giving yourself the freedom to work optimally in a flow state, you stand the best chance of producing truly outstanding results.</p>

<p>This is a win for everyone: the company sees better results, your coworkers have clear guidelines for getting in touch for help and information, and you get more done in fewer hours — which gives you the opportunity to <a href="http://lengstorf.com/work-to-live/">keep your life in balance</a>.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re going to do the work either way, so why not find a way that keeps your stress low and your overtime at a minimum?</p>

<h2 id="what-s-next:9bdf3bb94d9031e8bc4e49d3ce03f359">What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>

<p>If you’re like me, you’d love to get away from the crazy hours and soul-sucking demands of the &ldquo;always-on&rdquo; lifestyle, but you don’t feel like it’s possible.</p>

<p><strong>I was wrong. I just had to trust myself to take the first step.</strong></p>

<p>Don’t waste time like I did. You can start working less and accomplishing more today. I’ve put together a <a href="http://lengstorf.com/remote-work-course/">free step-by-step guide</a> to show you how.</p>

A three-hour dedicated window for your most important work won&rsquo;t ruffle too many feathers, and it will have a big effect on your productivity.

          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
