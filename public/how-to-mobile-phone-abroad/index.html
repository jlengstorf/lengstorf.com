<p>Since having a mobile phone is now more or less a requirement for being a functional member of society, it&rsquo;s important to find a way to get your hands on a phone while abroad.</p>

<p>The key benefit to having a working phone is access to wireless data, which is invaluable when you&rsquo;re trying to navigate a new city where the street signs aren&rsquo;t in English, or if you need to quickly look up how to say &ldquo;coconut oil&rdquo; in Thai.</p>

<p>In addition to the benefits of data, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to receive calls and texts from your friends and family in your home country.</p>

<p>Through a slightly confusing setup — I&rsquo;ll explain thoroughly, I promise — you can keep a local number while abroad, complete with text and picture message, while also setting up a local phone number.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s all <em>way cheaper</em> than a mobile contract in the United States.</p>

<h2 id="buy-an-unlocked-phone-with-a-sim-card-slot:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e">Buy an Unlocked Phone with a SIM Card Slot</h2>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve got your phone numbers and forwarding worked out, you&rsquo;ll need to have a phone that works in all the countries you want to visit.</p>

<p>Since most US mobile carriers subsidize the cost of phones with contracts, the phones they sell are locked — this makes them useless if they&rsquo;re not on that carrier&rsquo;s network and plans.</p>

<p><strong>To avoid insane roaming fees, you&rsquo;ll have to buy an unlocked phone.</strong> When you see the cost of an unlocked phone, you&rsquo;ll probably shit your pants — just remember that when you &ldquo;buy&rdquo; a phone with a contract, you&rsquo;re also committing to about $1,200 in phone bills over the next year, so a $600 phone isn&rsquo;t actually that expensive.</p>

<p>Make sure the phone you buy allows you to swap out the SIM card, and that it will work on GSM networks. If you&rsquo;re not sure what that means, do a search for the phone model you want to buy and whether or not it works in the countries you want to visit.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://amzn.to/1GyjrWh">purchased an unlocked iPhone 6</a>, and it&rsquo;s worked in the US, Europe, and Southeast Asia without any issues so far.</p>

<h2 id="buy-a-prepaid-sim-card-once-you-land:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e">Buy a Prepaid SIM Card Once You Land</h2>

<p>When I found out how cheap it was to have a prepaid SIM in other countries, I spent a half-hour ranting about how criminal the mobile carrier racket is in the US.</p>

<p><strong>Since I&rsquo;ve left the United States, I have spent less than $40/month on prepaid voice/text/data plans.</strong> Usually much less.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e:uk"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e:uk">1</a></sup></p>

<p>A quick search will point you to several discussions about the best SIM for whichever country you&rsquo;re headed to.</p>

<p>So far we&rsquo;ve used Three in both Italy and the UK, Yoigo in Spain, and TrueMove H in Thailand. Italy has been the most expensive so far at €35 for a month, and I think that was mainly because I didn&rsquo;t know what the hell I was doing and bought a more expensive package than I actually needed.</p>

<p>The easiest way I&rsquo;ve found to get a SIM is to <strong>go directly to a retail store</strong> for whichever carrier you choose, then <strong>find the prepaid plan that suits your needs.</strong> (We&rsquo;ve been able to find brochures in English almost everywhere, as well as people working the counters who are able to speak English well enough to get us set up.)</p>

<p>A word of advice: <strong>don&rsquo;t leave the store until you&rsquo;ve verified that you can get online, make a call, and send a text message.</strong> You probably won&rsquo;t run into any issues, but you don&rsquo;t want to find out an hour later that a step was missed — and you <em>definitely</em> don&rsquo;t want to try and explain what&rsquo;s happened to a different employee whose English is about as good as your Italian.</p>

<h3 id="having-a-local-number-helps:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e">Having a Local Number Helps</h3>

<p>A benefit that I didn&rsquo;t initially consider when getting SIM cards is the bonus of having a local number wherever you are.</p>

<p>In Barcelona, we made friends with some locals, and being able to shoot them texts without anyone spending a fortune was very handy.</p>

<p>In London, calling local businesses to ask if they had something we needed was an enormous time-saver.</p>

<p>It won&rsquo;t come up often, but when it does, it&rsquo;s great to know you&rsquo;ve got that covered.</p>

<h3 id="the-data-plans-are-cheap-if-you-re-reasonable:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e">The Data Plans Are Cheap — If You&rsquo;re Reasonable</h3>

<p>Data usage is usually pretty cheap, and the allowances are reasonable.</p>

<p>For me, &ldquo;normal usage&rdquo; consists of getting directions and looking up places in Google Maps, checking various social networks once or twice a day, sending a few photos to my friends via MMS, and occasionally asking Google to settle debates.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e:debates"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e:debates">2</a></sup></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re live-streaming everything you do through Periscope, your mileage may vary.</p>

<h2 id="staying-connected-to-your-us-based-friends-and-family:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e">Staying Connected to Your US-Based Friends and Family</h2>

<p>To make sure your loved ones don&rsquo;t have to pay international calling rates to get in touch with you, you can leverage Google and Skype to make sure you can still receive calls — just like you were still in the US.</p>

<h3 id="get-a-google-voice-number:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e">Get a Google Voice Number</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the US, <a href="https://www.google.com/googlevoice/about.html">Google Voice</a> is a simple option to give yourself a US-based number that friends can call or text.</p>

<p>With a Google Voice number, you can call or text your friends right from the Gmail app, as well as from the Hangouts app. <strong>Your incoming calls and texts can be forwarded to any US-based phone number</strong> — I&rsquo;ll talk about how to work around this a bit later — or to your email.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re also able to set up voicemail with custom greetings, call blocking, and more.</p>

<p>When you use your computer (or the Hangouts app on wifi) <strong>you can make calls and send texts from your Google Voice number for free.</strong></p>

<p>This is a great way to make sure your family and friends don&rsquo;t have to contact you through an app — my parents, I&rsquo;m sure, greatly appreciate not having to learn what the hell a WhatsApp is.</p>

<h3 id="set-up-a-skype-number-for-call-forwarding:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e">Set Up a Skype Number for Call Forwarding</h3>

<p>To work around Google Voice&rsquo;s US-only call-forwarding restriction, <strong>you can get a <a href="http://www.skype.com/en/features/">Skype number</a></strong> for $60/year, which allows you to forward the calls to international numbers in most countries.</p>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve set up the Skype number, <strong>set your Google Voice number to forward to it.</strong> Turn off any of Skype&rsquo;s extra features, like voicemail, to make sure that the call goes through to your phone and your Google Voice voicemail.</p>

<p>Once this is set up, you just have to remember to set the Skype number to forward to your local number wherever you&rsquo;re staying.</p>

<h2 id="staying-connected-is-easier-and-cheaper-than-you-might-think:05de7e06ea2ff2f01726437f01c6663e">Staying Connected Is Easier (and Cheaper) than You Might Think</h2>

<p>I was concerned before I left that I&rsquo;d have a really difficult and expensive time trying to stay connected abroad. I was concerned I&rsquo;d need to ration my data usage, tell my friends to stop texting me, and pay a fortune to call home.</p>

<p>But with a little bit of legwork up front, it turns out that <strong>I&rsquo;ll actually <em>save a shitload of money</em> this year over what I was spending to keep a phone through Verizon in the US.</strong></p>

<p>After seeing the ease of setting it up, and the savings of going prepaid, I&rsquo;m a believer; I&rsquo;ll be a hard sell to ever get a mobile contract again.</p>

<p>
<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>
  If you&rsquo;re like me, the idea of traveling permanently while making a living probably seems like a dream — but you don&rsquo;t think you can pull it off.
</p>
<p>
  I felt that way right up until I actually boarded a flight to leave the United States. And now I can&rsquo;t believe I didn&rsquo;t start living this life sooner.
</p>

          I&rsquo;m Jason Lengstorf: an author, speaker, and digital nomad.
        </h2>
        <div class="footer-about__copy">
          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
