<p>At a sleepover in second grade, my friends put on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094761/"><em>The Blob</em></a> — a horror film about space jelly that kills anyone it touches. I was so scared I started crying and my mom had to pick me up to take me home.</p>

<p>Another night I snuck out of my bedroom while my parents watched TV, and I saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPdDdC4go6c">sewer scene from <em>It</em></a>. My dad had to remove everything that even <em>sort of</em> resembled a clown from the house.</p>

<h2 id="i-wasn-t-scared-of-the-story:71461a143c15f7631f6fc455b3a9044a">I Wasn&rsquo;t Scared of the Story</h2>

<p>In both cases, I actually barely saw any of the movie that frightened me. I saw that the movie was a scary movie, I knew that scary movies terrified me, and I knew that watching a scary movie would scare me too badly to be able to sleep.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t realize, however, was my fear of horror films — and the fear I felt when I imagined what terrors those films might contain — was all it took to ruin my day.</p>

<p><strong>I was scared of the movies themselves.</strong> The <em>idea</em> of the movies.</p>

<p>It was so bad that I only had to see the cover of <em>Child&rsquo;s Play</em> in a video store to end up petrified and sleepless for a few nights.</p>

<h2 id="find-out-how-it-ends:71461a143c15f7631f6fc455b3a9044a">Find Out How It Ends</h2>

<p>As an adult, I still don&rsquo;t care for horror films. But if I start watching one, I now force myself to finish the movie.</p>

<p>When I see a scene from a horror film — just like I did when I was a kid — I build a vague, terrifying beast out of my fear of the movie, and this unknowable shape is more monstrous than anything I&rsquo;ll see in a movie. I don&rsquo;t care how good the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery">CGI</a> is.</p>

<p>I have to see the end. I need to know what happens. What <em>really</em> goes on in this movie?</p>

<p><strong>There is no way the actual outcome will be scarier than what I can dream up in my ignorance.</strong></p>

<p>By seeing the full movie, I learn the reality of the story, and that takes away the paralyzing power of my ignorance and fear.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:71461a143c15f7631f6fc455b3a9044a:the-ring"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:71461a143c15f7631f6fc455b3a9044a:the-ring">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="take-away-its-power:71461a143c15f7631f6fc455b3a9044a">Take Away Its Power</h2>

<p>Most of our fears are imaginary.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t know what comes next, so we make projections about the future. And in our imaginations, the potential for catastrophe is alarmingly high.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:71461a143c15f7631f6fc455b3a9044a:out-of-my-league"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:71461a143c15f7631f6fc455b3a9044a:out-of-my-league">2</a></sup></p>

<p>But we&rsquo;re not actually scared of the experience. We&rsquo;re scared of the unknown: the vague, monster-shaped outline in our imagination.</p>

<p>By facing that fear, we replace the monster with a memory. And even if the memory is uncomfortable or humiliating, it&rsquo;s very unlikely that it will be as horrifying as the make-believe nightmare scenario we dreamed up before.</p>

<h2 id="shining-a-light-into-monster-shaped-shadows:71461a143c15f7631f6fc455b3a9044a">Shining a Light into Monster-Shaped Shadows</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>To take power away from your fear, give it a name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an effort to limit the number of monsters occupying my headspace, I try to push my fears into reality and name them.</p>

<p>Am I feeling anxious about a client who seems unhappy with my work? Call them and clear the air.</p>

<p>Is there an unresolved tension between me and a family member? Let&rsquo;s sit down and get to the bottom of things.</p>

<p>Is my laundry room haunted? Let&rsquo;s go stand in there and find out.</p>

<p>Whenever I notice a situation that scares me, I try to jump in earlier rather than later, because the end result is always the same: I face the fear and realize the difference between what I <em>thought</em> was wrong, and what was <em>actually</em> wrong is staggering.</p>

<p>What I thought may have been a relationship-ending issue with the client turned out to be a few small adjustments and ten minutes of screensharing to show them how to use a tool.</p>

<p>After a beer with the family member, we realized we were both working toward the same goal even though our methods were clashing.</p>

<p>My laundry room is creepy as shit. But it&rsquo;s not haunted.</p>

<p>Once a fear is dragged into reality and exposed to a little daylight, the giant monster-shaped shadow in my imagination shrivels to a small, silly bit of information.</p>

<h2 id="name-your-fears:71461a143c15f7631f6fc455b3a9044a">Name Your Fears</h2>

<p>What monsters are lurking in your imagination right now? How many of them can you drag into reality?</p>

<li id="fn:71461a143c15f7631f6fc455b3a9044a:the-ring">Sure, <em>The Ring</em> still scared the shit out of me, but I didn&rsquo;t lose any sleep afterward. I can guarantee the things my brain will dream up out of a storyline involving a dead girl who haunts your TV are <em>far worse</em> than what happens in the movie.

<li id="fn:71461a143c15f7631f6fc455b3a9044a:out-of-my-league">For an easy example, imagine asking someone out on a date that you think is &ldquo;out of your league.&rdquo;<br><br>I get anxious imagining it: I see her across the room, obviously more successful, socially adept, and better-looking than me. She&rsquo;s smiling, sharply dressed, surrounded by people who are laughing at the devilishly clever observation she just made about current events of which I&rsquo;m appallingly ignorant.<br><br>And here I come — trying to look confident but probably smiling like a crazy person, food caught in my beard, smudges on my glasses — to interrupt her conversation. I tell a joke that doesn&rsquo;t land, laugh loudly at my own joke out of discomfort, turn tomato-red in self-conscious embarrassment, and stammer my way through awkward compliments that are just making her more uncomfortable.<br><br>I never even get to the part about asking her out.<br><br>She laughs in my face. The people around her laugh in my face. Everyone in the room perks up, and she grabs the microphone from the party&rsquo;s emcee.<br><br>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, a special announcement: Jason Lengstorf is a useless idiot who lacks the charm of a papercut and smells like he&rsquo;s been eating nothing but cheese for the last eight weeks.&rdquo;<br><br>The story makes the news later that night, and I&rsquo;m forced to flee the country in shame. I live out the rest of my days in Bulgaria harvesting sugar beets in exile.<br><br>The reality, however, is that — while <a href="http://lengstorf.com/miss-montana/">I&rsquo;d probably still blow it</a> — the actual situation would be far less ridiculous. I&rsquo;d say hello, she&rsquo;d say hello, I&rsquo;d try to make conversation, and when we didn&rsquo;t hit it off I&rsquo;d make an exit. This isn&rsquo;t exactly a storybook ending, but it&rsquo;s nowhere near the worst-case scenario my imagination cooks up.

          I&rsquo;m Jason Lengstorf: an author, speaker, and digital nomad.
        </h2>
        <div class="footer-about__copy">
          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
