<p>Years back, before I moved to Portland, I used to haunt a bar called Al&rsquo;s and Vic&rsquo;s in Missoula, Montana.</p>

<p>This was one of those dives where it was too loud to hear yourself think and the floor was <em>always</em> sticky, but they sold a bucket of PBR for four dollars, and a Montana Happy Meal<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a9230ef37d6ab8576e9d5a8c6b83f1bf:happymeal"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:a9230ef37d6ab8576e9d5a8c6b83f1bf:happymeal">1</a></sup> for five.</p>

<p>On a night where I&rsquo;d been called in as wingman for Scott, we met with his date and — for the span of a beer — I did my best not to make him sound like a degenerate.</p>

<p>His date, whose name I don&rsquo;t remember but whose face looked like a Bernadette, told us her friends were arriving and would we mind standing at the bar with them.</p>

<p>Bernadette introduced us to her friends, Mandy and Kate. Mandy, it turns out, was a friend of Scott&rsquo;s, and the two of them pulled Bernadette into conversation, leaving Kate and I to fend for ourselves.</p>

<p>Kate was beautiful. Like, <em>holy shit</em> good-looking — the kind of attractive that usually requires about a grand&rsquo;s worth of Photoshop cleanup.</p>

<p>I, on the other hand, was wearing a cowboy shirt with pearl snaps, sporting an extra twenty pounds or so, and unshaven in the not-sexy way.</p>

<p>Still, despite my homeless desperado ensemble, we hit it off immediately.</p>

<p>She was funny, sharp-witted. I was scrambling to keep up, but she was laughing. The hoarse mating calls of a hundred college kids were muffled under the sound of her voice, like bourbon over fine-grit sandpaper.</p>

<p>The faces around us blurred and faded; it was just me and Kate and my beer and her whisky diet and this moment.</p>

<p>My brain was leaking that special cocktail of chemicals that only happens the first time you make a connection with someone. In that moment I understood how people can meet and fall in love and end up making long-term promises to each other in front of an Elvis impersonator — all in the span of one intense night.</p>

<p>The spark between us had magnetized the air; my heart was trying to pull out of my chest.</p>

<p>Bernadette reappeared over Kate&rsquo;s shoulder, and the room snapped back into focus.</p>

<p>Mandy was with her, and Scott returned a moment later with a fresh bucket of beer.</p>

<p>Scott gave me a <em>how&rsquo;d it go for you</em> look. I tried not to look upset about the interruption.</p>

<p>The girls did their secret eye contact telepathy thing, and Bernadette started preparing her exit. Mandy and Kate took her cue and started gathering their purses and phones.</p>

<p>Kate caught my eye as she swung her coat around her shoulders, and my heart went all squishy and weird.</p>

<p>I formed the words in my brain — <em>ask for her number</em> — opened my mouth to speak — <em>ask for her number, you idiot!</em> — and I said, &ldquo;It was really nice meeting you. Have a great night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She might have hesitated. I was too disgusted with myself to notice. The next thing I knew I was watching her hair bounce in the red bar-glow as she walked away.</p>

<p>I thought of running after her, telling her I couldn&rsquo;t let her get away without knowing I could see her again.</p>

<p><em>Maybe that&rsquo;s romantic? Probably creepy. Better not.</em></p>

<p>I thought of asking Scott for Bernadette&rsquo;s number so I could call her and ask for Kate&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><em>That&rsquo;s even worse. Stop it. All of your ideas are bad.</em></p>

<p>I did nothing. I watched the door close behind her. My mouth was probably hanging open.</p>

<p>And Scotty — never one to pass up a kidney punch — said, &ldquo;Blew that one, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took the beer he offered and did a poor job of acting nonchalant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know who she is, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a special kind of schadenfreude that only men experience. It occurs when we watch a friend — hitting it off with a woman who is clearly out of his league — suddenly and spectacularly self-destruct.</p>

<p>I was a teeball benchwarmer. Kate was one good season away from the big show.</p>

<p>Scotty was so darkly gleeful he should have been stroking a Persian cat as he said, &ldquo;She was Miss Montana last year.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Goddammit.</em></p>

<p>I had a shot with Miss Montana, and I let her walk out of the bar. After fifteen minutes of great conversation and good chemistry.</p>

<p>I replayed the moments before she left in my head. I met her eyes. <em>She was waiting for you to ask.</em></p>

<p>I had a shot. I did nothing.</p>

<h2 id="the-wasted-second-chance:a9230ef37d6ab8576e9d5a8c6b83f1bf">The (Wasted) Second Chance</h2>

<p>A couple weeks later, I was out with Scotty again.</p>

<p>It was late, and we had slunk into the bar everyone despised. The sign on the door said &ldquo;Bodega&rdquo;, but it may has well have been called You&rsquo;re Hammered Again &amp; None of the Girls Will Talk to You, Huh?</p>

<p>Out front, I bummed a cigarette off a stranger and wobbled gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jason?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I wheeled and found myself facing Kate. I immediately stamped out my cigarette. I could feel the air starting to magnetize again.</p>

<p>Kate smiled. And then she hugged me. Her hair smelled like vanilla-scented heaven.</p>

<p>I smelled like an ashtray full of whiskey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So how are you?&rdquo; I managed to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great! Oh, by the way, these are my brothers, Jeff and Mark,&rdquo; she said, motioning to the two frighteningly large men who flanked her.</p>

<p>I nodded. They nodded back, then pretended not to pay attention while this drunken asshole in front of The Saddest Bar in Missoula tried to flirt with their sister.</p>

<p>But somehow we just fell back into it. She teased me about my smoking, I poked fun at the shoes she was carrying, and we both laughed. My heart did the squishy-weird thing again.</p>

<p>And then it was time to make the move. Her brothers weren&rsquo;t going to stand there all night, and I needed to head back inside before Scott ordered me any more drinks.</p>

<p><em>Get her number.</em></p>

<p>I tried scraping every last bit of courage off the walls of my rib cage.</p>

<p><em>Just ask. Ask for her number.</em></p>

<p>I tried to think of a line.</p>

<p><em>Here&rsquo;s a line, dickhead: &ldquo;Can I get your number and call you sometime?&rdquo; Just. Ask.</em></p>

<p>And then I caught eyes with the larger of her two brothers. And then I wondered if I&rsquo;d misread the whole situation and she was just being nice to me. And then I froze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hey, it was great seeing you again. I should probably get back inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.</em></p>

<p>I flushed. I couldn&rsquo;t even make eye contact.</p>

<p>As suddenly as she&rsquo;d appeared, Kate — Miss Montana — the gorgeous, funny girl I love-at-first-sighted (twice) was gone into the night. For good this time.</p>

<h2 id="lost-in-the-woulds:a9230ef37d6ab8576e9d5a8c6b83f1bf">Lost in the Woulds</h2>

<p>We would have been a great couple. She would have had a secret family recipe for waffles and a mean Scrabble game. Maybe her disturbingly attractive genes would compensate for my hairiness and we&rsquo;d make the world&rsquo;s hottest babies.</p>

<p>She would have shot me down. We&rsquo;d have only had another thirty seconds of good conversation left in us. She would have had a boyfriend. I would have hated her guts after two weeks of hanging out. Or, more likely, she&rsquo;d have hated mine.</p>

<p>I would have made a thousand wonderful memories, starting with the one where I asked if I could call and she said yes.</p>

<p>I would have made a thousand mistakes and alienated myself from the Montana Beautiful Women&rsquo;s Club<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:a9230ef37d6ab8576e9d5a8c6b83f1bf:mtbwc"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:a9230ef37d6ab8576e9d5a8c6b83f1bf:mtbwc">2</a></sup> forever.</p>

<p>Any of those outcomes would have been fine. Even bad experiences are still <em>experiences</em>, you know?</p>

<p>But the <em>wondering!</em> The wondering is murder. There&rsquo;s no lesson to learn in <em>not</em> trying.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s just the nagging of an unanswered question.</p>

<p>So now, I&rsquo;m not the guy who took a long shot with a beauty queen and succeeded against the odds.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also not the guy who took a shot and missed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m just a guy who had a shot and stood there looking foolish while the clock ran out.</p>

          I&rsquo;m Jason Lengstorf: an author, speaker, and digital nomad.
        </h2>

          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
