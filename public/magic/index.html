<h2 id="the-curse-of-knowledge:ff97c92e1c05a70f26fbea1e816810cb">The Curse of Knowledge</h2>

<p>When I was first starting out in business, I read a book called <a href="http://cptr.me/XoBEmg"><em>Made to Stick</em></a>. Among other things, I was introduced to The Curse of Knowledge, which is the idea that — as we become more familiar with a given topic — we are unable to explain an idea well to someone who doesn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>Think about any time you&rsquo;ve played charades, and by the end you&rsquo;re ready to scream at your team, &ldquo;How could you <em>not</em> get that?!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In your head you were perfectly pantomiming <em>Gone with the Wind</em>.</p>

<p>What your team saw was you riding an imaginary horse and waving your fingers like you were casting a spell.</p>

<p><strong>Once you <em>know</em> something, it&rsquo;s extremely difficult to see it from the perspective of someone who doesn&rsquo;t.</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-other-curse-of-knowledge:ff97c92e1c05a70f26fbea1e816810cb">The Other Curse of Knowledge</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s another curse of knowledge, though, and it&rsquo;s a little sneakier. <em>The Revenge of the Curse of Knowledge</em>, if you will.</p>

<p>

<p>When I was young, I thought my dad was basically a wizard because he could tie shoes.</p>

<p>I thought my mom was conjuring up cookies through some dark art or another.</p>

<p>Tiny people lived in my television to entertain me.</p>

<p>A rabbit and a fat man broke into my house to leave candy and gifts every so often.</p>

<p>My closet was a portal to the worst place imaginable.</p>

<p><strong>The world was full of magic, and I was awestruck.</strong></p>

<h2 id="disillusionment-or-how-the-magic-died-in-a-book:ff97c92e1c05a70f26fbea1e816810cb">Disillusionment, or How the Magic Died in a Book</h2>

<p>Eventually, I learned how to tie my shoes. I added the ingredients my mom had measured out into a bowl and watched cookies take shape. I learned enough about TV signals to know there weren&rsquo;t actually tiny people in there. Dad spilled the beans about Santa and the Easter Bunny.</p>

<p>(The closet still creeps me out, though.)</p>

<p><strong>Bit by bit, the magic was stripped away and the simple truth about how things worked was laid plain.</strong></p>

<p>I was no longer awestruck. Instead, I was condescending to the people around me who hadn&rsquo;t learned yet.</p>

<h2 id="a-world-without-magic:ff97c92e1c05a70f26fbea1e816810cb">A World without Magic</h2>

<p>Every time I see something amazing, it feels like magic. I&rsquo;m blown away. I tell my friends. If there&rsquo;s a YouTube clip, I&rsquo;m sharing it.</p>

<p><div class="embed-container aligncenter">
  <iframe width="750" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8F6EoMdn95E?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
</p>

<p>I saw this guy — <a href="http://dubfx.com/">Dub FX</a> — on the streets of Amsterdam, and I was <em>convinced</em> he was a sorceror.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a dude with a microphone. He starts singing. Then&hellip; <em>holy shit what just happened? <strong>It must be magic!</strong></em></p>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s a talented musician who can beatbox and operate a looping station.</p>

<p>Impressive? Absolutely.</p>

<p>Magic? Not at all.</p>

<h2 id="losing-my-sense-of-wonder:ff97c92e1c05a70f26fbea1e816810cb">Losing My Sense of Wonder</h2>

<p>But it&rsquo;s not just entertainment and childhood stories that have lost the soft glow of pixie dust; I&rsquo;ve felt a similar sense of disillusionment with my own life.</p>

<p>When I first started <a href="http://copterlabs.com/">building websites</a>, code was still fairly mystical to me. I could do a few things, but most of what I saw was beyond my grasp; otherworldly manifestations brought forth by the legendary Mystics of Nerd.</p>

<p>Successful freelancing was a dark art. Saving money required an incantation from a book bound in human skin. If I wanted to be any good at sex, I needed to sacrifice a goat at Kilauea.</p>

<p>But the more I learned, the more I realized that none of this is sacred, supernatural, or even secret. There are no shortcuts. No &ldquo;weird tricks&rdquo; to make someone suddently good at a skill.</p>

<p><strong>There is no magic. It&rsquo;s all just hard work, practice, actually giving a shit.</strong></p>

<p>Well, who cares if there&rsquo;s no magic? We&rsquo;re adults, dammit, and magic is for children. And David Blaine.</p>

<p>Sure. That&rsquo;s fair.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m not ready to give up my sense of wonder. I like being blown away by something that I don&rsquo;t understand.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:ff97c92e1c05a70f26fbea1e816810cb:at-first"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:ff97c92e1c05a70f26fbea1e816810cb:at-first">1</a></sup> I want to be surrounded by wizards and fairies and sorceresses who are making impossible things happen all around me.</p>

<p><strong>If I lose my sense of wonder, then I&rsquo;m resigning to a life of familiar, comfortable tasks. I&rsquo;m assuming that there&rsquo;s nothing left to surprise me.</strong> Giving in to the part of me that&rsquo;s jaded and pessimistic that beleives there&rsquo;s nothing new anyways and why bother at all.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d like myself without the hope for magic.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-can-we-bring-the-magic-back:ff97c92e1c05a70f26fbea1e816810cb">So How Can We Bring the Magic Back?</h2>

<p>The problem with The Revenge of the Curse of Knowledge is that once you&rsquo;ve seen behind the curtain, you can&rsquo;t unsee it. The wizard is just a dude with a killer pyrotechnics setup.</p>

<p>So there&rsquo;s no going back to the kind of awe and wonder we felt as children. And that&rsquo;s probably okay; I lost a lot of sleep wondering if my uncle would ever give my nose back, and I just couldn&rsquo;t afford that today.</p>

<p>But we can find new magic, and remember to <em>actually feel</em> that amazement that comes along with seeing something new and wonderful.</p>

<p>It can be big stuff, like learning that there were <a href="http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/first-ever-swimming-dinosaur-ate-sharks">shark-eating dinosaurs</a> or that scientists are working on <a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140826/ncomms5712/full/ncomms5712.html">tiny robots that fight cancer</a>.</p>

<p>Or it can be the little things we might completely dismiss if we&rsquo;re not paying attention: when the new project you&rsquo;re working on falls into place for the first time; when the outfit you chose today gets compliments from everyone you meet; when you think to yourself, &ldquo;I really wish I had a blueberry muffin,&rdquo; and then someone from the office lets you know there are muffins in the break room and should they save you one.</p>

<p><strong>Our lives are full of small, magical moments.</strong> If we&rsquo;re looking for them, that is.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-magical-in-your-life-right-now:ff97c92e1c05a70f26fbea1e816810cb">What&rsquo;s Magical in Your Life Right Now?</h2>

<p>Think back over the last few days. <em>What&rsquo;s happened that felt like magic?</em></p>

<p>I wanted cheesecake the other night, and a local bar had a cheesecake special that night. I toured the Willett Distillery, saw how some of my favorite bourbon is made, and sampled some of the very rare, expensive labels. I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gsnrzr0Bm80">discovered a band</a> that makes my hair stand on end.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not quite Santa Claus, but it&rsquo;s enough.</p>

<p><strong>Where have you felt a little bit of magic in your life lately?</strong></p>

          I&rsquo;m Jason Lengstorf: an author, speaker, and digital nomad.
        </h2>
        <div class="footer-about__copy">
          <p>
            I&rsquo;m also an Overkill Cult survivor.
            In 2013 I was working 70&ndash;90 hours a week &mdash; it got
            so bad that patches of my beard started falling out. I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle before it killed me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 I sold everything I owned and started traveling the
            world. I thought it would be hard, but it&rsquo;s been
            surprisingly easy to work remotely from places like Barcelona,
            London, and Chiang Mai.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I&rsquo;m doing is exciting, but I&rsquo;m not special. <em>Anyone
            can do this.</em> If you&rsquo;ve ever dreamed of working remotely and
            exploring the world, I want to help you make your dream a
            reality.
