# This Is My Personal Site â€” [lengstorf.com](https://lengstorf.com)

This is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)-powered site where I talk about the things that I'm doing to try and live the best life I can, both professionally and personally.

All of my blog content lives here, including unpublished drafts (but be nice; they're not edited). I also [keep track of post ideas as issues](https://github.com/jlengstorf/lengstorf.com/issues) and encourage discussion about those ideas to make sure I am 1) making sense, and 2) not sounding like a dick.
