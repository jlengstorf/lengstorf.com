People ask me what I use pretty regularly. This page collects all of that
information to save everyone time.

## Code Editor / Terminal

- My preferred code editor is
  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I’ve used other editors,
  and they were all good at some of the things. VS Code is currently good at all
  of the things I need it to be good at.
- My editor font is
  [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/). It costs
  money, which I happily paid, and I would happily pay for it again.
- My editor theme is
  [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl)
  by the wonderful [Sarah Drasner](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/). It’s Very
  Good™ and I wholeheartedly endorse it.
- I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) for command line stuff. I’m not enough
  of a power user to notice the difference between terminals, so probably don’t
  listen to me about this.
- I have a few custom things set up in my terminal, which you can see in my
  [dotfiles](https://github.com/jlengstorf/dotfiles).

## Desktop Apps

- I use [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/) for email and pay for it gladly.
  It warms my nerdy heart. I’ll probably refer you if you ask nicely.
- I spend an unreasonable amount of time in [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). It’s
  really good at video calls and screen sharing.
- My browser is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Livestreaming Stuff

I run a [weekly Twitch livestream](https://twitch.tv/jlengstorf).

- You can
  [watch me walk through my livestreaming setup on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB4_mpLdmsg).
- I use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) for the actual streaming part.
- I designed the scenes and artwork in [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (with a
  heavy assist on the logo from [Florian Kissling](https://twitter.com/fk)).

## Audio/Video setup

- My audio setup is pretty much everything
  [Joel Hooks said to use](https://joelhooks.com/dSLR-webcam-for-live-streaming)
- I use a [Sony a5100 dSLR](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00MHPAFAG/) as a
  webcam.
- Using a dSLR requires the
  [Blackmagic Web Presenter](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01N5YEI0O/) to turn it
  into a webcam.
- I hang the camera off my monitor using a
  [GorillaPod 5K](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B074WG19MP/).
- I use a
  [Fotodiox Pro FlapJack Studio LED](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B013TSPWXO/)
  for lighting.
- The light sits on [this stand](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B001D2GQ8Y/).
- I have a
  [Shure SM7B microphone](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm7b)
  with a windscreen for audio.
- My mic is on a
  [RODE PSA swivel mount boom arm](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B001D7UYBO/), but
  it’s
  [kind of uncooperative because the mic’s not heavy enough](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1020445057294319617).
- I use a
  [VersiFold Acoustic room divider](https://www.versare.com/shop/versifold-acoustical-room-divider.html)
  to control echo and to act as a backdrop.

The end result of this is over-the-top:

Setting up this A/V rig taught me two things:

1. [Joel Hooks](https://twitter.com/jhooks) only has one setting:
   [H.A.M.](https://youtu.be/UtoHI0JEfDg?t=107)
2. I probably could have done _a lot less_ and gotten a Good Enough™ result, but
   it definitely feels nice to have high quality audio and video running.

## Desk setup

- I have a
  [Jarvis adjustable-height desk](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html)
  with the contoured top.
- I sit in a
  [Herman Miller Embody chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/embody-chairs/).
  I’ve bought this chair twice (before and after
  [my long-term travel adventure](/two-years-in-airbnbs/)) and would definitely
  buy it again.
- I use a MacBook Pro. No idea what the specs are. It’s a computer. I kinda like
  the touch bar.
- I have an LG UltraFine display as a second monitor. I don’t remember the specs
  on this either.
- I use a standard Apple magic keyboard and trackpad. I tried to get into
  mechanical keyboards and just wasn’t able to do it.
