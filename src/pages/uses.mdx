People ask me what I use pretty regularly. This page collects all of that information to save everyone time.

## Code Editor / Terminal

* My preferred code editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I’ve used other editors, and they were all good at some of the things. VS Code is currently good at all of the things I need it to be good at.
* My editor font is [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/). It costs money, which I happily paid, and I would happily pay for it again.
* My editor theme is [Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) by the wonderful [Sarah Drasner](https://sarahdrasnerdesign.com/). It’s Very Good™ and I wholeheartedly endorse it.
* I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) for command line stuff. I’m not enough of a power user to notice the difference between terminals, so probably don’t listen to me about this.
* I have a few custom things set up in my terminal, which you can see in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jlengstorf/dotfiles).

## Desktop Apps

* I use [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/) for email and pay for it gladly. It warms my nerdy heart. I’ll probably refer you if you ask nicely.
* I spend an unreasonable amount of time in [Zoom](https://zoom.us/). It’s really good at video calls and screen sharing.
* My browser is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

## Livestreaming Stuff

I run a [weekly Twitch livestream](https://twitch.tv/jlengstorf).

* You can [watch me walk through my livestreaming setup on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB4_mpLdmsg).
* I use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) for the actual streaming part.
* I designed the scenes and artwork in [Figma](https://www.figma.com) (with a heavy assist on the logo from [Florian Kissling](https://twitter.com/fk)).

## Audio/Video setup

* My audio setup is pretty much everything [Joel Hooks said to use](https://joelhooks.com/dSLR-webcam-for-live-streaming)
* I use a [Sony a5100 dSLR](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00MHPAFAG/) as a webcam.
* Using a dSLR requires the [Blackmagic Web Presenter](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01N5YEI0O/) to turn it into a webcam.
* I hang the camera off my monitor using a [GorillaPod 5K](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B074WG19MP/).
* I use a [Fotodiox Pro FlapJack Studio LED](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B013TSPWXO/) for lighting.
* The light sits on [this stand](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B001D2GQ8Y/).
* I have a [Shure Beta 87A microphone](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0002BACBO/) with a windscreen for audio.
* My mic is on a [RODE PSA swivel mount boom arm](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B001D7UYBO/), but it’s [kind of uncooperative because the mic’s not heavy enough](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1020445057294319617).
* I use a [VersiFold Acoustic room divider](https://www.versare.com/shop/versifold-acoustical-room-divider.html) to control echo and to act as a backdrop.

The end result of this is over-the-top:

<blockquote className="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Also my desk looks absurd now. <a href="https://t.co/xNEZhCkwfj">pic.twitter.com/xNEZhCkwfj</a></p>&mdash; Jason Lengstorf (@jlengstorf) <a href="https://twitter.com/jlengstorf/status/1106304180937986070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2019</a></blockquote>

Setting up this A/V rig taught me two things:

1. [Joel Hooks](https://twitter.com/jhooks) only has one setting: [H.A.M.](https://youtu.be/UtoHI0JEfDg?t=107)
2. I probably could have done _a lot less_ and gotten a Good Enough™ result, but it definitely feels nice to have high quality audio and video running.

## Desk setup

* I have a [Jarvis adjustable-height desk](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html) with the contoured top.
* I sit in a [Herman Miller Embody chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/embody-chairs/). I’ve bought this chair twice (before and after [my long-term travel adventure](/two-years-in-airbnbs/)) and would definitely buy it again.
* I use a MacBook Pro. No idea what the specs are. It’s a computer. I kinda like the touch bar.
* I have an LG UltraFine display as a second monitor. I don’t remember the specs on this either.
* I use a standard Apple magic keyboard and trackpad. I tried to get into mechanical keyboards and just wasn’t able to do it.
