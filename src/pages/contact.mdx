If you want to contact me, here’s how to do it:

## Reach Out on Social Media

For most quick questions, I prefer social media because:

1. The discussion might benefit other people
2. Other smart people might have better thoughts than I do
3. Social media encourages brevity

I’m most active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jlengstorf), but you can also find me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jlengstorf).

## Set Up a Call for In-Depth Questions

If you question requires more than 280 characters in response, it’s probably pushing into consulting territory. And that’s okay — I’m always happy to do coaching and consulting calls — but I do charge for my time.

To make this easy and charge per-minute, I use [Clarity](https://clarity.fm/jlengstorf). If you want to get into details, talk specifics, or even put together a personalized action plan for you or your business, request a 15-minute call and we’ll do amazing things together.

## Or Send Me an Email — But Be Patient

If you _really_ love email for some reason, you can also send an email to <jason@lengstorf.com>. But be patient: I don’t check it all that often, and I prioritize email below pretty much everything else.
