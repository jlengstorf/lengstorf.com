Here’s the truth: whether you’re working in a traditional office job, contracting for a big company, or doing your your own thing as a freelancer, it’s possible to live the “digital nomad”[^dn] lifestyle: **living anywhere in the world, making your own schedule, and earning money with nothing but a laptop, an internet connection, and your sexy-ass brain.**

[^dn]:
  I really dislike the term “digital nomad”, because it creates the impression that there’s some kind of secret club that you have to be initiated into. There isn’t.

_Any_ job that’s done through a computer can be done remotely: I know accountants, writers, designers, developers, marriage counselors, travel gear producers, and customer service reps (and many more) who can do their jobs anywhere.

## But despite its recent popularity, this lifestyle isn’t for everyone.

Remote work requires building skills that go beyond simply doing your job. It requires self-experimentation, finding joy in chaos and uncertainty, and hurling yourself head-first into an adventure that changes for every person who takes it on.

Most of all, it requires tapping into your emergency stores of courage — and doing something that will make everyone you know simultaneously question your grip on reality and _envy the Christ out of you_.

### If you’re cut out for location-independence, though, life can be more amazing than you’ve ever imagined.

Just to list the obvious benefits:

- **You’ll be able to travel the world** and see what’s out there with your own eyes.[^pinterest]
- **You’ll earn a living doing work you love** — or at least make it more possible to do things you love in addition to working.
- **You’ll experience a level of freedom most people only dream of.** _“Can I Winnie-the-Pooh it[^wtp] on a video meeting?”_ You bet. _“Spontaneous dance parties?”_ I’d be disappointed if you didn’t. _“Can I tempt fate and knock out some work from the jacuzzi?”_ I don’t recommend it, but who the fuck am I to tell you what to do?

## I’m Jason, and I’ve been working remotely for over a decade.

From 2014–2017, I traveled the world, staying in a new city for a month or two before moving on to the next place that sounds interesting. Now I work from my home office in Portland, Oregon, where I rarely put on real pants.

**Making my income location-independent has been the single most impactful thing I’ve ever done.** And I know I’m not the only one.

### I want to help you work remotely and make a good living.

To help you determine how to make remote work a possibility for you, I’ve put together a 6-step checklist to help you get started.

#### What you’ll learn:

- **How to create a location-independent income source** (or how to make your current job remote-friendly).
- **The additional skills remote workers _need_ to master** if they intend to _remain_ remote workers.
- **A remote worker’s most valuable tool** for balancing work and play. Because what good is having the freedom to live anywhere if you can’t go explore?

### Enter your name and email and I’ll send you the free 6-step checklist right now.
