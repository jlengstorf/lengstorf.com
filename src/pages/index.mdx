## What are we giving up for the grind?

I used to think the only way I’d ever _really_ succeed was if I worked twice as hard and twice as long as everyone else.

And for years, I did exactly that. **I worked 70–90-hour weeks.** I answered emails at 3am. I walked out of dinners with friends to take calls for work.

I thought this was normal. **I thought working crazy hours was _required_ if I wanted an above-average career.**

## I was really, _really_ wrong.

I felt trapped by my career. **I felt like I had to sacrifice everything now for the sake of my future.**

And, sure, I was seeing progress at work — but **the rest of my life was in shambles.**

I rarely saw my friends and family. I was chronically overtired. I was gaining weight. And then it got scary: **my beard started falling out in clumps.**

## I needed to make a change — and _fast_.

When my body literally started falling apart from the stress of my job, I had to face up to a hard truth: **all of this hard work and sacrifice wouldn’t be worth much if I wasn’t healthy enough to enjoy it later.**

I got serious about controlling my time. I started taking care of myself. I was ready to damage my career if it meant I could be healthy and happy again.

After I made the changes, I braced myself for the consequences.

But something strange happened: **I started getting more done.**

My business grew. I doubled my income. I was doing better work than ever before. It seemed impossible, but somehow **working fewer hours made me _more_ productive.**

## You can build an incredible career without sacrificing your health.

The steps I followed can work for anyone, and **I want to show you how I did it. For free.** No gimmicks, no sneaky upsells, and no bullshit — I just want you to be happy, healthy, and successful.

I’ve boiled down my success to **5 immediately actionable strategies**, and I want to share them with you.

Just click the button below, enter your email, and **I’ll send them over right now.**
