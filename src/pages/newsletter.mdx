If you like my content and want to read more of it, then you’ve come to the
right place, my friend: **I send out a newsletter whenever I write something
new.**

In addition to letting you know when I’ve published new content on my site, **I
occasionally send out shorter thoughts and ideas _only to subscribers_. If
you’re big on exclusive content, this might be fun for you.**

<OptIn button="Join Now" group="DEFAULT" source="/newsletter/" />
<OptInNotice>
  Note: I will never share your email or spam you with nonsense. Because I’m not
  a dick.
</OptInNotice>
