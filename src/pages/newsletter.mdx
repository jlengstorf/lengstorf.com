If you like my content and want to read more of it, then you’ve come to the right place, my friend: **I send out a newsletter whenever I write something new.**

In addition to letting you know when I’ve published new content on my site, **I occasionally send out shorter thoughts and ideas _only to subscribers_. If you’re big on exclusive content, this might be fun for you.**

<OptIn button="Join Now" group="DEFAULT" source="/newsletter/" />
<OptInNotice>
  Note: I will never share your email or spam you with nonsense.
  Because I’m not a dick.
</OptInNotice>
