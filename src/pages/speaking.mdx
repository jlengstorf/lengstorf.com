I’m available for speaking gigs; just
[contact me](mailto:speaking@lengstorf.com?subject=Speaking+Inquiry). I’d be
happy to speak about my experiences with remote working, business-building, or
web design and development.

Currently I’m focusing on giving presentations in the following areas:

- **Work-Life Balance and Efficiency:** raising awareness about the health and
  career risks of overworking, teaching high-efficiency habits, encouraging
  downtime
- **Building Effective Teams:** process design, designing healthy culture,
  onboarding, internal training
- **Modern Front-End Development:** progressive web apps, high-performance
  patterns, React + GraphQL, architecture, testing, functional programming
- **GraphQL:** managing GraphQL servers, using GraphQL in microservice
  architectures, combining GraphQL with REST

For a full list of the ideas I’m kicking around right now, see
[my presentation list](https://github.com/jlengstorf/presentations). If I’ve
given the presentation before, the slides are up there, too.
